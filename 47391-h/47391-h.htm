<p class="pc4 xlarge">JOHN BROWN.</p>

<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE CADET SCHOOL.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">No</span> doubt you have seen, in the highways
and byways, a lot of youths in khaki
with white bands round their caps. These
‘boys’ are called cadets, and are usually men
home from the front to train for commissions.
In Sandhurst they are officially styled gentlemen
cadets; but apparently we are not supposed
to be gentlemen&mdash;we’re just cadets. Funny,
isn’t it? But that’s the way of the army.</p>

<p>Well, my name is John Brown&mdash;a very
ordinary name&mdash;and I’m one of those fellows.
Before the war I evaded toil by becoming a
student, and spent a lot of time on ‘ologies and
‘osophies. Now I’m learning to be a <i>pukka</i>
officer, and the leader of sixty men to the
cannon’s mouth.</p>

<p>When I left my battalion for the cadet
school I shed no tears. They were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
trenches, or, rather, in the mud. And it cost
a pair of brand-new boots to get on to the
road. However, I survived, and in due time
landed at Windmoor. This is a ‘blasted
heath,’ swept by the winds, and isolated from
picture-shows, barmaids, and revues; not a
petticoat in sight, and at every corner a notice
which amounts to: ‘England expects that
every cadet this day will do his duty.’</p>

<p>‘This is no Utopia,’ I muttered, falling into
the first hut by the way. Ye gods! There
was an old colonel, with eyes like a hawk and
cheeks like dumplings; and what do you think
he was doing? <i>Cutting his corns.</i></p>

<p>‘What the&mdash;why the&mdash;who the devil <i>are</i>
you, sah?’</p>

<p>‘John Brown, sir,’ I said meekly, for never
in my life had I seen such a perfect relic of
the Napoleonic wars.</p>

<p>‘Get to blazes out of this, John Brown!’
he roared, putting his fat feet on the floor and
banging the door. I was again alone&mdash;on the
blasted heath. The old gent inside was Colonel
Eat-All, the commandant. Rumour says he
devoured two dervishes at Omdurman. I
stumbled on once more, and found the orderly-room.</p>

<p>‘This way,’ said Sergeant-Major Kneesup,
introducing me to the adjutant. I clicked my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
heels in the style of a Guardsman, and saluted
like a railway signal.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ said a blasé-looking gent with three
pips, looking up at me from his papers.</p>

<p>‘John Brown, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Who sent you here?’</p>

<p>‘The War Office.’</p>

<p>‘Umph! I know nothing about you. You
had better go back to your regiment for your
papers.’</p>

<p>‘But I can’t go all the way to France, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Well, no&mdash;perhaps not. Wait a minute,’ he
said, ringing a bell. A clerk answered.</p>

<p>‘Have you any papers dealing with Cadet
John Brown?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. Came a fortnight ago.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. That’s all.’ The clerk went
out.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s all right, Brown. Just go over to
No. 1 Company. You’ll see Sergeant-Major
Smartem there. He’ll fix you up. Good
luck!’ he concluded with a genial smile.</p>

<p>I saluted and went out, marvelling at the
<i>methods</i> of the British Army.</p>

<p>I dug out the sergeant-major, and again
announced that I was John Brown.</p>

<p>‘That’s a fine name to go to bed with.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the one my mother gave me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, you can’t help it. Here’s your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
blankets; there’s your bed. You’ll get your
equipment to-morrow. Shove this white band
on your cap. Tea’s at five o’clock. The
lavatory’s down there. That’s the canteen
over yonder. And when you want writing-paper,
hymns, or free salvation, there’s a
Y.M.C.A. down the road. Now, push off&mdash;<i>John
Brown</i>.’</p>

<p>I was extremely grateful for all this information
in tabloid form, but I had a lurking
suspicion that my name was going to be
a subject of rude jest. However, I am an
optimist. I pitched my bag into a corner of
the hut, pulled out a little book called <i>The
Pleasures of Hope</i>, and commenced to read
till tea-time. But I was disturbed. Cadet
after cadet came filing in. They were all
new and rather green, except one man, called
Beefy Jones.</p>

<p>‘What a ruddy place for a cadet school!’ he
roared.</p>

<p>‘My dear chap, it is designed to protect our
morality,’ muttered a spectacled youth, who
looked like (and proved to be) an ex-parson.</p>

<p>‘Morality! After all that time at the
front! What a jest!’ exclaimed Beefy, banging
his kit down.</p>

<p>In half-an-hour we were all good pals.
Beefy confided to me that he had a ripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
girl five miles away, and she had a jolly sister.
If I wanted an intro., it was all right. He
would fix it up. While the ex-parson&mdash;Billy
Greens by name&mdash;suggested that I might help
him to hand out the hymn-books at Sunday
services. I promised to do so. (My father
was in the Diplomatic Service.) And so
twenty of us settled down to life in our hut
at Windmoor Cadet School.</p>

<p>Tea-time proved that the rations were good,
and when Lieutenant Blessem (our platoon
officer) came round for complaints, we shouted,
‘None, sir.’</p>

<p>‘That’s a good start,’ he said with a smile.
‘I want you boys to be happy here. If you’re
in trouble, or want to know anything, come
down to my hut and I’ll help you. But
remember this, boys’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What, sir?’ said Beefy.</p>

<p>‘This platoon has got to be top-hole at
everything.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear, sir!’ we roared, rattling our
plates as he went out. Blessem was a sport.
After tea we got piles of books thrown at us,
as well as the standing orders of the school&mdash;a
moral code akin to the Koran, insisting on
sobriety, sincerity, and big salaams. These
orders endorsed the ancient theory that women
and wine are the root of all evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Beefy grinned, then shoved me on the back
of his motor-bike and whirled me over to Sweetville,
where I was introduced to Adela, a peach
of a girl, who had never been kissed. What
luck!</p>

<p>It was 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> when I met Adela. I kissed
her at 9; promised to marry her at 9.15;
and at 9.30 (to the minute) Beefy and I were
answering roll-call at the camp five miles away.
Some hustle&mdash;eh, what?</p>

<p>We made our beds down and got in between
the blankets. About ‘Lights out’ there was
an infernal din outside the hut. Somebody
was running round shouting, ‘John Brown!
Where the ‘ell’s John Brown?’ Then some
fifty huts started a chorus of&mdash;</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">‘John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave,<br />
As we go marching along,’ &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p1">Beefy led the chorus in our own hut&mdash;much
to my annoyance. At last the door opened,
and the sergeant-major bawled, ‘Silence!’
They shut up. He next inquired if John
Brown lived there.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sergeant-major. Here I am.’</p>

<p>‘Telegram for you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, thanks,’ I muttered, thinking it was
some wonderful effusion from Adela. On
opening the brown envelope I read: ‘Sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
you cough-drops, Keating’s powder, and body-belt.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mother.</span>’</p>

<p>As the lights went down I thought of the
dear, good soul who was so careful of my welfare.
Mothers may be silly, but they <i>always
love their boys</i>.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Next morning we were routed out at reveille,
and hunted off to tub ourselves in an open-air
wash-house. One fellow, ‘Ginger Thomson,’
objected. We carried him out and flung him
into the bath&mdash;clothes and all. There was no
early parade that day, so we got ready for the
commandant’s inspection at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> This was
a real good show. We were formed up in
close column of platoons. At 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> (to the
minute) Colonel Eat-All came bouncing on to
the parade-ground&mdash;like a great Rugby football&mdash;dressed
in khaki and splashed with ribbons.
He had every decoration from the Order of the
Blue Nile to a Companionship of Serajobitch
(with swords). My word, he looked his part!
I trembled.</p>

<p>‘Well, gentlemen,’ he said, ‘I’m glad to
meet you. I hope we’ll get on together, but
I’ll have no nonsense, no slacking, and no
back-answers. I’ve trained lions, burglars,
and Gurkhas, and have commanded everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
from mule transport to camel corps. You’re
here to work&mdash;<i>work</i>. And when I’ve finished
with you, you’ll be fit to scale the Alps, and
eat Germans or smelling Bulgars. You won’t
get strategy out of the <i>Bystander</i> or tactics
from the <i>Pink-Un</i>. The infantry drill book is
better than Nat Gould, and <i>Needham’s Tactics</i>
more important than the sexual stuff of Oscar
Wilde. Keep out in the open air, and don’t
hug the stove and the tea-pot. Get your
tummies hard, so that you can live on boot-leather,
horse-flesh, and cinders. War is to the
strong, and you’ve got to be supermen&mdash;and
gentlemen. We produce no jelly-fish in this
emporium. We want “white men” and leaders.
We’re up against the Hun. He isn’t a d&mdash;&mdash; fool!
Get that out of your headpieces. If
you are going to beat him, you have got to
know the tricks of Boney, the science of
Maude, and the dare-devil tactics of Allenby.
You can get all this <i>here</i>, if you pay attention
and carry out your job. Good luck to you!’
And off he stamped, to the amusement of all.
As he passed my platoon he caught sight of
me. My mouth was open.</p>

<p>‘What’s your name, my lad?’</p>

<p>‘John Brown, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if you keep your mouth open like
that in Mesopotamia, you’ll catch everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
from black cholera to cerebro-spinal meningitis.
Keep your mouth shut&mdash;John Brown!’</p>

<p>From that day every cadet in the battalion
took up the gag of, ‘<i>Keep your mouth shut</i>&mdash;<i>John
Brown</i>!’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SERGEANT-MAJOR FROM THE GUARDS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">Cadet</span> schools are not perfect military
academies; nevertheless, they are interesting
resorts. This school was not only a
fount of learning, but a school for manners and&mdash;in
a way&mdash;a minor university. Although,
as I have said, I was a student of ‘osophies
and ‘ologies before the war, the discovery that
my knowledge was limited soon came to me.
This is a happy condition, and the only basis
whereon to achieve future success. For all
that, I am no groveller at the feet of lecturers.
An officer must form his own opinions, and if
I am going to be of any use in this military
business, I must riddle the wheat from the
chaff, and gather the harvest into my store.
To be independent in thought is not uppish.
It is personality! Personality is the whole
thing in war, but never despise&mdash;<i>the other
fellow</i>.</p>

<p>Now I have to make a confession. Before
the war, when I was blundering around with
golf-clubs and feminine charmers, the Brigade
of Guards often passed my way. This seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
a wonderful machine, officered by men whom I
imagined to be Beau Brummells and Byrons.
Well-drilled automatons was all I thought of
them. To me they were just fancy soldiers
and ornaments of the Court. But who would
say that now? Think of Ypres! And remember
Cambrai! When the line was broken
and my brigade was ‘bu’st,’ they came up like
Trojans. They crossed the lines of trenches
almost dressing by the right. Their faces
were set, their bayonets shone, and they dived
into hell and destruction with a valour that
was amazing. They saved the British Army&mdash;and
fifty men on the General Staff their
jobs.</p>

<p>Salute the Guards!</p>

<p>Now, at this school where I, John Brown,
was sent to learn the arts of war, our
sergeant-major was from the Scots Guards.
He was a wonderful man! When he drilled
us I hated him like the Kaiser, but when he
had finished with us I felt a smarter man.
Beefy Jones and I agreed that Sergeant-Major
Kneesup was much too German, and
yet, somehow, we wouldn’t have given him to
the Germans for quids. Oh, he was a big fish
on parade. In appearance he was like a well-cut
statue. His eyes were of the X-ray kind.
He could tell when there was a hole in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
socks, or cotton-wool (instead of a heavy great-coat)
in your pack. When he shouted he was
like a fog-horn, and every command was finished
with a <i>click</i> that gave you the jumps. Before
we went on parade we cursed him, and vowed
we would see him far enough before we jumped
about like automatic toys; but when we got
there he simply threw us about like kids. <i>The
man was a marvel.</i></p>

<p><i>That first parade!</i> Oh, what a nightmare!
Some of us were a bit late, for in the army
you’ve got to be standing on parade five
minutes before the hour allotted. The S.M.
said nothing, but when the hour struck he
bellowed ‘Shun!’ in a way that made half of
us drop our rifles with fright.</p>

<p>‘Pick ‘em up! Pick ‘em up! Look sharp!’</p>

<p>I gripped my gun with a shiver, and knew
the squad were about to enter Dante’s Inferno.</p>

<p>‘Squad!... Shun!... As you were!’
he roared. ‘When I say “<i>Shun!</i>” come up to
it.... There’s cobwebs in your brains, and
wax in your ears.... Stand still, that man
with the egg on his mouth, and hair like
Caruso.... I can see <i>all</i> of you.... I am
a blankety octopus, I am.</p>

<p>‘Squad!... Shun!... Still!... Not
a move!... There’s a long-nosed gentleman
twiddling his little fingers as if he’s got St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Vitus Dance.... This isn’t a home for
epileptics or a sanatorium for delirium tremens....
It’s an officers’ school, and I belong to
the Brigade of Guards.... Twenty-five years’
service, five medals, and the D.C.M.... I’ve
drilled kings, princes, field-marshals, yokels,
and hobos; and, by Gawd! I’ll drill you off
the face of the earth.... By the right&mdash;quick
march!’ And off we stepped.</p>

<p>‘He’s a bit thick,’ mumbled Beefy to me.</p>

<p>Now, Beefy had hardly worked his lips when
he made the remark, but the eagle eye of that
S.M. had caught the culprit.</p>

<p>‘Squad&mdash;halt!’</p>

<p>We stopped in terror, and poor old Beefy
began to perspire with fright.</p>

<p>‘Now, I’ll have no talking on the march,
and no back-answers.... Discipline is discipline!
If you can’t keep your mouth shut on
the square, you’ll jabber on a night attack....
I’m the gramophone in this business.... I
can read your thoughts and see your brains....
To me you’re all as plain as a pikestaff....
I’ve only seen you ten minutes, but I’ve
ticked off the lame, the lazy, the insubordinate,
and the mad.... I’m Sherlock Holmes, I
am. By the right&mdash;quick march!... A full
step now! Shoulders square.... Heads
erect.... March like the Guards.... Left&mdash;right&mdash;left....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Left.... Left&mdash;right&mdash;left....
Right&mdash;form!... Slowly now&mdash;slowly!...
Swing round like a gate! Get
back, that man with the nicotine on his fingers
and the brilliantine running down his neck....
Forward&mdash;by the right!</p>

<p>‘Keep your dressing, there. By Gawd! I
could get the Chinese Militia or the Boys’
Brigade to beat you at this game. Heads up,
or you’ll drop your eyeballs.... Straighten
your legs like sticks, and don’t double your
backs like dudes in Bond Street. About
turn!... By the left.... Keep your hands
down.... Never mind the sweat on the
brow.... Let the flies lick it off.... Keep
up. Keep up.... You’d never make a show
at Buckingham Palace or Hyde Park.... If
you can’t drill, you can’t beat the Germans....
Keep your dressing, there!... When the
Brigade of Guards went into action at Ypres,
they marched by the right and filled the gaps
of the dead to keep a straight line.... When
I fought at Belmont and Graspan, my company
marched into action with whiskers, eyeballs,
and tummies all in line.... That’s the thing
to put the fear of God into the enemy. Squad&mdash;halt!...
Not a move!... Order&mdash;arms!...
Stand at&mdash;ease! As you were! Who
said “easy”?... None of your infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
dodges here. That’s all right for an armed
mob&mdash;not for me. Squad&mdash;stand easy!’</p>

<p>‘He’s the ruddy limit,’ said Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Yes. This isn’t a school. It’s a bally
penitentiary,’ I said, wiping the perspiration
off my brow. My shirt was sticking to my
back, and I felt beastly uncomfortable. At
the moment I hated Sergeant-Major Kneesup,
but yet in my real heart I admired him. He
was a man’s man, hard as nails, merciless to
the inefficient, but the A and the Z of that
wonderful system which has made the Brigade
of Guards a terror to every despot in Germany.
As we looked at him walking up and down
the square he resembled a true-born aristocrat,
and yet he was once a ploughman. A
wonderful product of a hard, yet marvellous,
system.</p>

<p>‘Squad&mdash;shun!... Stand&mdash;easy! Now,
come round here, boys. I’m going to talk
with you.’</p>

<p>The term ‘boys’ melted our fears, and we
gathered about him.</p>

<p>‘It’s like this! A lot of you imagine when
you get knocked about that it’s a sort of punishment;
for I know your thoughts. I’ve been
through all this. When I joined the Guards
we did the old-fashioned slope. They used to
stick you close to a wall, and if you were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
smart the wall tore all the skin off your fingers
when you chucked the rifle up. That has
been done away with, but the old-fashioned
discipline remains. Some of you may think
it brutal, but, believe me, it gets results. It
makes men smart. It makes them obey. It
turns them into gentlemen. I used to be a
ploughman&mdash;now I’ve got a pension, a little
pub, and a farm. I wouldn’t call the Kaiser
my cousin, and I learned <i>everything</i> in the
Guards.’</p>

<p>‘But don’t you think we need more intelligence
and less of this Peninsular stuff, sergeant-major?’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit less. Men are still the same&mdash;very
human. Let drill, discipline, and orders
slide, and your men will get panicky for the
want of it. Now take my tip: all of you boys
are going to be officers, so model your drill on
mine. Your men will hate you at first, just
as you hate me when I’m knocking you about;
but when your colonel turns round and says,
“Lieutenant John Brown has the smartest-drilled
platoon in this battalion,” the men will
lick your boots for you. Tommy’s a funny
fellow. He doesn’t really admire a slack officer.
He likes the officer who knows his job. If you
want to get them up to the scratch, drill like
the Brigade of Guards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘But, look here, sergeant-major, aren’t other
corps as good as the Guards?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, my boy. But still I must tell
you this, that the Guards are nearly always kept
in reserve, not because they are pets, but to
save awkward situations. It’s not we that
should be saying it, but you’ll admit that at
Cambrai we managed to keep things right,
eh?’</p>

<p>‘By Jove, you did!’ exclaimed a few of the
cadets who had been there.</p>

<p>‘Whatever regiment you join, you’ve got
to feel and believe that your regiment is
<i>It</i>. Every regiment has different traditions.
There’s the Old Devons, Wilts, Surreys, and
all the Highland corps. They’re wonderful
stuff. And if I dared to talk to them about
the Guards they’d bash my head in. And
quite right, too! That’s <i>esprit de corps</i>. But
at the moment you are all cadets. You belong
to no regiment, and if I can hand on any of
the good ideas I’ve got from other good men,
you will profit by it.’</p>

<p>‘But it’s ruddy hard to learn from you,
sergeant-major,’ piped Beefy, who was still
steaming with perspiration.</p>

<p>‘My dear boy, I’m mild compared to some.
When I was a “rookie” I used to come in
with my feet bleeding, my heart pumping like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
an engine, and limbs like lead. You don’t
really know what drill is. I’m mild&mdash;real
mild. And when you’ve finished here we’ll
all part good friends. Don’t worry! A number
nine pill will help you through all right.
You’re too fat. Now, fall in!’</p>

<p>For the next half-hour he knocked us about
like ninepins. Every nerve, every muscle, was
on the jump. He knew every trick of drill,
and turned us inside-out. To an observer it
must have been a treat to watch him. But to
us it was more or less hell. Yet he quickened
our wits and roused our ardour so that every
man Jack said, ‘Well, it’s up to us to knock
spots off the Guards.’ And that was his real
and only aim, for he was a true soldier. He
dismissed us with a smile, and said we weren’t
really a bad lot. We rejoiced.</p>

<p>I was so delighted after the ‘Dismiss’ that
I commenced to throw my rifle up in the air,
and catch it.</p>

<p>‘Hi, there!’ shouted the S.M.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What’s your name?’</p>

<p>‘John Brown, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Carry your arms properly&mdash;<i>John Brown</i>.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="pch">CUSTOMS OF THE SERVICE.</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">The</span> old ‘com.’ fairly caught me out at the
‘prelim.’ We had a general knowledge
paper set&mdash;a fairly easy thing. I finished
mine in about half-an-hour; then, getting bored
waiting for Beefy, I started to write some
skittish answers for my own amusement.
Beefy, who is a practical joker, got hold of
these, and when we were asked to pass our
papers up, substituted the wretched things for
my real answers. Just to show you how I put
my foot in it, here are samples of the silly tripe
I concocted.</p>

<p>(<i>Q.</i>) What is meant by strategy? (<i>A.</i>)
Giving a fellow a thick ear&mdash;suddenly.</p>

<p>(<i>Q.</i>) Explain the term Tactics. (<i>A.</i>) Correct
handling of a platoon when passing a
brewery.</p>

<p>(<i>Q.</i>) What is an outpost? (<i>A.</i>) A military
mortuary.</p>

<p>(<i>Q.</i>) What is meant by camouflage? (<i>A.</i>)
Wearing a Burberry to hide a hole in your
pants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>Q.</i>) Who is Allenby? (<i>A.</i>) The fellow who
<i>didn’t</i> make a mess of Gaza.</p>

<p>(<i>Q.</i>) What should an officer always say to
the men? (<i>A.</i>) ‘Get your hair cut.’</p>

<p>Now, just imagine what the old ‘com.’
thought of me when he went through this
piffle. I was in a blue funk. To make matters
worse, it was Saturday and leave-day. Adela
had got her mother and father off to a Red
Cross bazaar, and she had engaged the drawing-room
for us&mdash;all to ourselves. Beefy and
her sister had commandeered the dining-room.
This heavenly prospect was damped by a
terrible cloud.</p>

<p>‘Cheer up, John Brown,’ said Beefy.</p>

<p>‘That’s all jolly fine, Beefy. You’ve let
me down, and if I get chucked out, it’s all
your fault.’</p>

<p>‘You’re a ruddy pessimist. The old colonel
is a sport. He’ll be tickled to death. Of
course, he will probably have you up, make a
hellifa fuss, &amp;c.; but when you go out he’ll
burst with laughter. You have got no
humour, you silly ass. And you forget that
the old chap used to do things at Sandhurst.
Hang it all! it’s only a rag; and if there’s
trouble, John, I’ll own up. I’m not a sneak.’</p>

<p>‘Fall in for lecture,’ shouted the C.S.M.
‘And, I say,’ he added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What, sergeant-major?’</p>

<p>‘Is John Brown here?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘You’re for orderly-room after the lecture.
Make your will out. You’re going to be
hanged, drawn, and quartered.’</p>

<p>‘Right-o!’ I answered, making the best of
a bad job.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>We then marched away to the lecture-hall
to hear the adjutant on his favourite topic&mdash;’Customs
of the Service.’ He was not a bad
lecturer, and quite funny at times. We called
him ‘Blasé Percy.’ He had been at Mons,
the Marne, and Ypres. Half his nose was off;
he had a glass eye, a dummy hand, a silver
plate in his tummy, and a game leg. Poor
chap! no wonder he was <i>blasé</i>. For all that,
he was a sport, and had the Legion of
Honour.</p>

<p>‘Now, gentlemen,’ he said, ‘when you’ve
finished wiping your feet on the tables, I’ll
start. You’ve got to go through it, so don’t
go to sleep. My lecture is “The Customs of
the Service.” When you leave here you will
have commissions. And when you join your
regiments, try to do “the correct thing.” Don’t
lurch into your new battalion like an actor-manager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
looking for trouble. Slide in quietly,
just like a little dawg. If you’re not humble
by nature, look as humble as you can. When
reporting to the adjutant, don’t have a woodbine
between your lips and your hands in your
pockets. He will eat you alive. When I was
a sub. I saved myself an awful lot of trouble
by cutting the English Dictionary down to
two words&mdash;“Yes, sir.” If you’re not brainy,
that’s quite a good scheme. The adjutant will
mark you down as decent and harmless, and the
men won’t know. Of course, this beastly war
has upset our easy old system. You’ve got to
be intelligent to please the newspapers. It’s a
bit of a bore, but the best people are trying to
do it, and it’s good to be in the fashion. At
the same time, it isn’t the correct thing to argue
the point with majors and colonels. They are
big-bugs in the military scheme, and should an
old gentleman announce in the anteroom that
Macedonia is in Texas, or that Florrie Forde
is the wife of President Wilson, don’t call him
a liar. You will make him unhappy, and when
he gets you on parade, he’ll most likely twist
your tail. Use your brains, certainly; but
don’t advertise them&mdash;that’s bad form.</p>

<p>‘A man is judged by little things, and it is
very easy to discover a man’s temperament
and schooling. For example, in one battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to which I was attached, a gorgeous youth
barged in and presented his card to the adjutant
as if he were a commercial traveller.
Mark you, he was only joining his battalion
that day; but the adjutant was amused to
read the following:</p>

<table id="t02" summary="t02">

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3" class="tdclm"><i>LIEUT. TED TIDDLEWINKS, Esq.</i>,</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td colspan="3" class="tdc"><i>1st Batt. Bombing Buffs.</i></td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdcred" style="width: 40%;">Tel. address:<br />“Hustle.”</td>
  <td style="width: 20%;">&nbsp;</td>
  <td class="tdcred" style="width: 40%;">Red Villa,<br />Tooting.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>‘Now, that visiting-card was all right for
“The Bing Boys,” but it was no good for an
officer of His Majesty’s Service. I agree it
wouldn’t prevent our going on with the war.
And I am glad to say it was no indication of
the real ability of dear old Ted, as he turned
out to be. But officers are officers. We control
the actions of millions of men, and it’s not
at all a bad thing to make the British Army a
school for etiquette and good manners. Ted,
I may tell you, was an advertising agent in
civil life. He simply couldn’t help getting
that card printed. From his telegraphic
address you will observe he was a hustler,
and we can do with lots of men like him.
However, the adjutant handed him over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
me, and I got him to dump his one thousand
gold-edged, red-lettered visiting-cards into the
ashpit, and gave him a bit of pasteboard like
this:</p>

<table id="t03" summary="t03">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdclm"><i>MR TED TIDDLEWINKS,</i>,</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc"><i>1st Batt. Bombing Buffs.</i></td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>‘Thus was he shorn of all his gilt, his Esq.,
his Red Villa, Tooting, tel. address, and all the
fripperies of Suburbia. No officer requires a
brass band or a newspaper poster to announce
his commission or importance. The uniform
is good enough, and it’s a mighty good kit,
too. Ted was such a good fellow, so willing,
so generous, and afterwards so brave that we
adopted him as a regimental mascot. He’s
now a captain, a D.S.O. And what do you
think that devil Ted is going to do next
week?’</p>

<p>‘What, sir?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘He’s going to marry my sister.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear!’</p>

<p>‘My sister, I may tell you, is a jolly good-looking
gel&mdash;so is Ted good-looking&mdash;and
when she asked my benediction, I wired: “God
bless you, Red Villa and all.”</p>

<p>‘Another point. Don’t start attempting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
tip adjutants and colonels. You may be very
rich, and imagine that if you send me a gold
cigar-case studded with diamonds I shall pass
you out for your commission. Personally, I
should have no hesitation in court-martialling
a man who did so. I recall a youth named
Solomon M’Isaaks, who blew in from the
Argentine. Out there he had to deal with
grafters and twisters. To get business he had
to give palm-oil by the gallon. He was
not at all a desirable fellow. He wanted
short cuts to success, and didn’t like the
daily grind of orderly officer, drill, marching,
&amp;c. Somehow or other he suddenly conceived
the idea that by patronage he might
buy a colonelcy or a brigadier’s job. So he
started to throw fivers about like hot peas,
and ended up by sending a cheque to a brigade
major. That finished him. He was booted
out. If there is one thing we ought to be
proud of, it is that the British Army has not
the graft of South America. Merit counts,
although I’m just afraid a sneak soft-soaps his
way occasionally by acting the part of Uriah
Heap.</p>

<p>‘I may also tell you there are hundreds of
little things you have got to know. For
example, when the commanding officer enters
the anteroom every officer must promptly rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to attention&mdash;as a mark of respect. Colonels
do not insist on this from mere vanity. It is
really discipline, and as all of you may be
colonels some day, you will realise the benefit
of the system. Another custom is, when you
meet the C.O., the major, or the adjutant in
the morning, salute smartly, and say, “Good-morning,
sir.” If the C.O. had occasion the
day before to reprimand you for some error,
make a point of saying a cheerful “Good-morning,”
and he will <i>then</i> know that you are
no petty-minded individual.</p>

<p>‘Remember your table manners. For dinner
assemble in the anteroom five minutes
before the time. Allow the C.O. and seniors
to lead the way to the table, and take your seats
quietly. Don’t eat with your knife; and when
you finish a course, put your knife and fork
together. When a mess servant sees a new
officer leave his knife and fork sprawling all
over the plate he says nothing&mdash;but he thinks
a lot. He really believes the delinquent is
not a gentleman. And it is most important
that officers should convey to all ranks that
they have a knowledge of the courtesies
which are the hall-mark of all well-trained
people.</p>

<p>‘Of course, you may say, “What has all this
got to do with winning the war?” My reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is, it is <i>the whole scheme</i>. For example, the
German officer is quite a brave man, but he is
not a gentleman. His manners to the German
soldiers are the manners of a brute. He never
uses “please,” seldom “thanks;” while Faith,
Hope, and Charity are absent from his curriculum.
His whole life is based on brute-power,
the penal code, and&mdash;<i>orders</i>. What
a difference from the British Army! Our
discipline is the firmest, yet the kindest, in the
world, simply because cadets and <i>all</i> officers
have had their noses shoved on the grindstone
by sergeant-majors, lecturers, and seniors, who
insist that if you fail in your duty, and neglect
to cultivate the love and the friendship of
your men, then you are absolutely no use to
the British Army.</p>

<p>‘Again, when you want to leave the mess
table before the mess president does so, you
must go and ask his permission. On a guest-night
you must not leave the room, except
on a point of duty; and you should remain
with the guests of the evening till they go.</p>

<p>‘Here are a few more hints in brief, which I
call the Subaltern’s Ten Commandments.</p>

<p>‘(1) Thou shalt drink soda-water.</p>

<p>‘(2) Thou shalt not wear pink socks or
yellow shoes, or carry Mills grenades on leave
with the pin half-out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>‘(3) Thou shalt not address generals as
“Dear old Charlie.”</p>

<p>‘(4) Thou shalt not kiss V.A.D.’s&mdash;<i>in
public</i>.</p>

<p>‘(5) Thou shalt aspire to the V.C.&mdash;if thou
cannot become an R.T.O.</p>

<p>‘(6) Thou shalt smile, even when thy calf
has “stopped one.”</p>

<p>‘(7) Thou shalt permit the men to sing,
dance, and be merry, for on the morrow they
may die.</p>

<p>‘(8) Thou shalt covet the Kaiser’s blood,
his ox, and his ass, and everything that is
the Kaiser’s.</p>

<p>‘(9) Thou shalt be chivalrous.</p>

<p>‘(10) Honour thy King and serve thy
Motherland, that thy labours may gain unto
thee three pips and a D.S.O.</p>

<p>‘I think that is all just now, gentlemen,’
concluded the adjutant. ‘Fall out, please.’</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>At other times this most excellent lecture
would have cheered me up, but the coming
ordeal made me tremble, and I shuffled to the
orderly-room with a heavy, heavy heart. I
wasn’t worrying so much about what the ‘Old
Man’ was going to say; it was the thought
of my leave’s being ruthlessly cancelled that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
made me sick of life. Adela&mdash;alone in the
drawing-room&mdash;waiting for me. To be denied
that hour of crowded life seemed like cutting
the legs off a race-horse.</p>

<p>As I passed the orderly-room I saw the
commandant had a fierce and livery look, for
it was a raw, wet morning.</p>

<p>‘Quick march&mdash;right wheel&mdash;left wheel&mdash;halt!&mdash;Hands
back!&mdash;John Brown, sir,’ announced
the sergeant-major.</p>

<p>The ‘com.’ looked up. His eyes were
sparkling fire, his moustache was like that
of a walrus, his cheeks were puffed with
wrath, and his neck <i>was</i> red. He struck
terror into my soul, and I quaked like a schoolboy.
I didn’t know, of course, that this was
the official orderly-room manner, specially cultivated
by ancient mandarins to impress all
tyros with the majesty of military law.</p>

<p>‘Well, young man,’ he blurted out, ‘I have
seen your effusion. It’s all right for <i>Comic
Cuts</i>, but it’s a personal affront to me. Do
you think the army and the war a cock-eyed
revue for flippant cadets to throw their mocking
tosh’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Really, sir, I’m&mdash;I’m’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Silence, d&mdash;&mdash; you! You, a future officer,
get an examination-paper given you, and you
deliberately sit down and turn it into a music-hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
farce. It’s outrageous! It’s a scandal!
You’re a disgrace! When I commanded the
Fuzzy-Wuzzy Camel Corps I would have shot
an officer for such an offence. Do you realise
the enormity of your crime? It’s almost
treason. Under the Manual of Military Law
I can do anything with you for this. And if
I were the C.I.C. I might order you to be
strung up by the thumbs. What do you
mean, sah? What the devil do you mean,
sah?’ he concluded, stabbing the blotting-paper
with a pen and making it break into a
thousand fragments.</p>

<p>It was impressive&mdash;awe-inspiring! I felt
like a worm between two stones. I am five
feet ten inches, but at the moment I seemed
no higher than a grease-spot.</p>

<p>‘Please, sir, I’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘“Please” be d&mdash;&mdash;! Speak like a soldier.’</p>

<p>‘I did two papers, sir&mdash;the correct one and
this one. Unfortunately this silly one was
sent up. I did it for my own amusement.
I’m most awfully sorry, sir.’</p>

<p>‘You’re most <i>awfully</i> sorry, are you?
Where is the proper paper, then?’ he roared.</p>

<p>‘Here, sir,’ I said, handing it over.</p>

<p>His eye quickly scanned it over. ‘Humph!
saves your bacon, my lad. I was preparing
to heave you out, bag and baggage. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
you’re a youngster. I’ve got boys of my own.
I’ll give you a chance. Come again and
you’ll be shot! Now, are you due for leave
to-day?’</p>

<p>‘I hope you won’t stop it, sir. I’ve an
important engagement with a tailor about my
uniform.’</p>

<p>‘Did you say a tailor or&mdash;a lady?’ he
inquired, looking deep into my eyes.</p>

<p>‘A&mdash;lady, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I have no desire that an innocent
person should suffer for your misdeeds. You
can have your leave. But never come here
again&mdash;John Brown.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, sir.’</p>

<p>I was marched out. As the orderly-room
closed I heard the ‘Old Man’ burst into
laughter, and say to the adjutant, ‘By Jove!
we put the wind up that young bounder.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Yes, sir</i>,’ replied the adjutant.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="pch">WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">No</span> doubt our military dons believed that
after drill we swotted Haking, Needham,
Infantry Training, and Stonewall Jackson, not
forgetting <i>Notes from the Front</i>, and all the
pamphlets on soldiers’ bunions, number nine
pills, &amp;c. We certainly did swot&mdash;when they
were looking or moving around. But a cadet’s
day is a strenuous day. From 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> to
4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> running, drilling, lectures, and physical
jerks feed up the best of men, and we were glad
to leave shop and gather together round the
fire. There we unbared our souls, and made
no bones about it. Army life is an open life,
a much manlier life than even the public school.
There’s no beastly fagging, no ‘bloods,’ but
a universal hate of the prig and the prude.
War is a wonderful leveller. And at this
school there was a regular mix up of breeds
and classes.</p>

<p>These men were all tried men. They had
fought the Boche. Some had the M.M. or the
D.C.M. There were butchers and bakers,
jockeys, bookies, honours men, and backwoods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
adventurers. They were the cream of courage,
but&mdash;excepting Billy Greens&mdash;not the
soul of the Church. Fighting-men are really
primitive. They have seen life&mdash;and tasted
it. Women and wine had passed their way.
For all that, they were not sickly neurotics,
revelling in literary slime. They could
tell a yarn, of course, but that was no
evidence of decadence or softness. Men who
can beat the Boche are not soft-bottomed
sultans. They were hard as flint, yet as
gentle as babes.</p>

<p>In my own hut there were many characters.
Ginger Thomson, for example&mdash;the queer
beggar who wouldn’t wash. But he had the
M.M., as well as the French Military Medal,
and a brilliant record at Oxford. He entertained
us when he dissected our professors,
and it was good to hear him cross swords with
Billy Greens, the ex-parson. Greens hadn’t
the chest of a hen, but he was the Church
militant. He was a plucky little devil, and
if any man interfered with his evening devotions,
Greens would get up and fight. Nobby
Clarke was a howling Radical lawyer, inclined
to argue the point; while Tosher Johnson was
a Canadian cow-puncher. There were others,
not forgetting Beefy Jones, the lustiest beggar
who ever carried a gun. So, when gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
round, we were interesting. One night we
discussed religion.</p>

<p>‘Men can’t be intellectual and godly, old
chap,’ declared Ginger. ‘If you want us all
to sing psalms and chant “Holy, Holy,” you’ll
have to close the schools and breed us like
heifers and hogs. To be a Rationalist, one
need not be a morality-wrecker. Many unbelievers
are clean&mdash;cleaner than those who
attend communion on Sunday and break all
the Commandments on Monday. Clean up
the Church, and I’ll be a parson.’</p>

<p>‘How can we clean it up, when you’re
destroying any little good we can do?’ exclaimed
Billy Greens. ‘We’re not supermen&mdash;we’re
human. We can’t perform miracles;
and I’ll tell you this, old chap, religion is a
bulwark for the poor, the sick, and the blind.
Destroy the Church and you’ll destroy the
last shreds of public decency and restraint.
Your doctrine will plunge us into the moral
laxity of the Huns. We’re fighting for God
in this war, and that’s why I’m in. I loathe
the whole armour, but I won’t throw it off till
we rid the world of this canker and curse.
This is a holy war.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Billy, I’m giving you a hand, although
my views are not your views. Personally, if
all the padres were good fellows like you, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
would cut out my doubting and inquiring brain,
and become a sidesman in your parish church.
Religion is all right; it’s the average parson
who is all wrong. Some are the fag-ends of
humanity; others are ordained Don Juans;
many are mercenary adventurers; and only a
few are like you&mdash;real good men, who believe
in what they preach. Hang it all, Billy! half
your parsons are not men; they’re women in
breeks. You’re about the only man I’ve seen
fit to be Archbishop of Canterbury. When
I’m Premier, you’ll get the job.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear!’ echoed the boys, for Billy
Greens was a popular chap.</p>

<p>‘Your flattery’s well meant, Ginger, but
I’ve no need of it. I can carry my own bat.
You’re not morally bad. Indeed, you’re on
a higher plane than many. But, for all that,
your intellect makes you dangerous. And it’s
up to me to keep you in order. In this hut
I’m the Church militant, and if you convert
any of these boys to your doubting Rationalist
creed, I’ll take it out of your skin.’</p>

<p>‘By Gad, Billy! I <i>do</i> like your pluck. You’re
a white man, if you are a parson. I’ll be a
real good boy,’ murmured Ginger, who in his
heart had a swelling love for the plucky little
padre.</p>

<p>‘I’ll vote you in as a bishop too, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
I get into Parliament,’ interjected Nobby
Clarke.</p>

<p>‘Thanks, Nobby; but you’re a rotten Radical.
I’ve no use for your Mumbo-Jumbo trickery
and Manchester morality. Your crowd is a
mixed bunch of twisters and prudes. You sing
the Auld Hundred on Sunday, and pull down
the Established Church on Monday.’</p>

<p>‘Good old Billy!’ shouted Ginger.</p>

<p>‘My dear old Pieface, your Church won’t be
any good till you get Disestablishment. As
long as padres have got security of tenure,
they won’t work. They regard a living as an
investment. All you can get them to do is to
play bowls, read Elinor Glyn, and drink whisky
with the squires. They’re the enemies of
freedom, Free Trade’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘And Free Beer,’ piped Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Yes, they are political mandarins who
want to keep the Old Country in chains.
The Liberal Party will save all you High
Brows from revolution and anarchy. Yet you
won’t thank us. You gobble the <i>Morning
Post</i>, chew the <i>Spectator</i>, and lick the feet of
Arthur Balfour. You Tories are a damned
lot of nose-wipers and job-seekers. You
haven’t the stomach of a fly.’</p>

<p>‘What about Haldane?’ roared Beefy, who
got his politics from the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, what about him?’</p>

<p>‘The <i>Daily Mail</i> says his soul is in
Germany.’</p>

<p>‘If you read the <i>Daily News</i> you would find
that it was his Expeditionary Force which
landed in France in 1914, and his Territorial
Force which warded off invasion. All your
Tory Government did when in power was to
change the design of Tommy’s shirt-tail and
hand out caps made in Germany. You’re
great fellows for political swank and eye-wash,
but you haven’t the brains of a hen. And
even in your Tory Coalition Government
you’ve got to get Lloyd George to pull you
through.’</p>

<p>‘Nobby!’ cried Ginger.</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘I’m fighting your constituency at the
next election. You’re a pest, a peril, and a
blighter. And if the Boche doesn’t kill you,
I’ll smite you dead on the platform as soon
as you whisper Free Trade. Free Trade will
ruin the Empire. We’re going to have Protection,
even if I’ve got to lay you out on a
shutter of the <i>Daily News</i>. And I’ll bribe
the hooligans to smash up the printing-machines
of the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>. You
Radicals have got to be destroyed.’</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen,’ said Nobby, striking an oratorical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
pose, ‘look at this unwashed pro-consul
from Oxford. He’s really afraid of Advanced
Liberals passing a Utopian measure that every
citizen must be washed. And he, the product
of culture, the flower of chivalry, the superman,
would bribe the toughs to smash up the
<i>Manchester Guardian</i>! Oh Ginger, thy name
is Autocracy!’</p>

<p>‘Yours is Democracy, and it’s a pretty
rotten creed. You’re rushing us into a
Republic, with a President in overalls, and
Cabinet Ministers who drop their h’s, and
snore when they’re sucking their soup. You
won’t be happy till you see field-marshals as
bus-conductors and admirals as A.B.’s. You’ll
cut off the Colonies and let us fizzle out as the
inglorious scrap-heap of a once glorious old
Empire. Nobby, you’re a politician and a
public fraud.’</p>

<p>‘Is he?’ said Tosher Johnson, the Canadian.</p>

<p>We all looked up with a start. Tosher was
a dark horse.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ Ginger retorted with emphasis.</p>

<p>‘Well, I guess Nobby’s Free Trade is all
bosh, but he’s a man of push and go. You’re
too durned slow for a funeral over here. Your
hoofs are sticking in the feudal mud. An
earthquake’s the only thing to stop your
browsing on Homer and chewing the rag about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
“form.” This is the Dollar Age. Make
good or go under. You wowsers from Oxford
and Cambridge want your blinkers taken off.
The classics cut no ice in this age. Homer,
Socrates, and Plato won’t sever the ham-strings
of the Hun. When you were pottering
around on Shakespeare, Tennyson, golf, tennis,
and “Rugger,” the Hun was dumping his
goods in Canada and every bush town in the
Empire. It makes me sick to hear all this
gaw-damned talk in your papers. You’re a
fine people, but you only crawl. You won’t
run. If you don’t get a spark under your old
machinery, this old scheme will peter out like
Spain and Rome.’</p>

<p>‘Rotten materialism,’ shouted Ginger.
‘Your philosophy is “guessing,” your soul is
“calculating,” and you’re clean gone on
“results.” You’ve been taught no history.
Old things you don’t know or understand.
And when you land in the Old Country, you
want to bring your commercial morality into
the only decent Government in the world.
You’re all jolly good fellows. Fine soldiers!
Good citizens! But you’re dollar-mad, and
have no bottom in your politics or finance.
Smuts is a Colonial, but he doesn’t talk like you.’</p>

<p>‘He was at Cambridge. Good old Cambridge!’
shouted Beefy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes,’ answered Ginger. ‘Smuts is about
the only man you’ve produced at Cambridge.
He refused to play the giddy goat, and put
his nose down on the classics, logic, history,
and law. That’s what you want, Johnson.’</p>

<p>‘Not for me, old chicken. Homer never
built the C.P.R., Shakespeare ain’t a bit of
use on a Calgary beef-ranch, and Darwin’s
theory won’t milk a Holstein or a Jersey. A
clear head, a strong back, and a good riding-leg
cut ice in these times. Business is
business. And dollars keep up men and
munitions. You ain’t wise, Ginger.’</p>

<p>‘Well, boys,’ said I, butting in, ‘we’ve discussed
everything from bishops to Free Trade
and the classics, but we are getting muddled
and fogged. This fellow Ginger from Oxford
is paralysing our repartee and logic, and old
Tosher wants to make the Old Land into a
dollar-factory. It seems to me that the main
issue raised by this howling Radical, Nobby
Clarke, is whether we shall vote for Bolsheviks

Ginger, nor do I support all the
materialism of Tosher. But the future is
clearly a titanic contest between Republicanism
and Imperialism. I move we put it to the
vote.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="pch">A CANADIAN NEWSPAPER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">One</span> evening I was seeking for something
to read, when my eye lighted on a
strange-looking newspaper with American sort
of headings. I picked it up. It was <i>The
Shack Valley Times</i>, a typical Canadian production,
bright, brief, personal, and amusing.
I got all the milk records of the Dominion,
the price of wheat, the names of the mayor’s
last set of twins, and an obituary notice of a
famous race-horse. ‘Good!’ I thought, turning
over the page. Lo and behold! there was a
huge photo of Tosher and a full-page heading:</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">‘SHACK VALLEY’S NEW NAPOLEON,<br />
TOSHER JOHNSON, THE MAN-EATER,<br />
GOES TO SCHOOL FOR FIELD-MARSHALS.<br />
SPECIAL INTERVIEW.’</p>

<p class="p1">‘The boys and girls in Shack Valley,’ ran
the editorial introduction, ‘will be real glad to
know that Tosher Johnson of this city is
making good. When he left here in 1915 he
said he was out to win the war. Since then
he has been collecting scalps on the Western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
front. He has sloshed no less than twenty
Germans, and his name is famous from
Boulogne to Verdun.</p>

<p>‘Our correspondent, Jim Penman, at present
with the Canadian Forces, was fortunate enough
to secure a special interview with our gallant
townsman, who thus unbosomed himself:
“Tell the boys of Shack Valley that
I’m pushin’ real hard in the fireworks business,
and have got the option of a corner lot in
Ypres to shove old Kaiser Bill into when we
Canadians get him. It isn’t all beer and
dollars out here. It’s all mud and death by
instalments. Since leavin’ home I’ve lost my
false teeth, two stones off my corporation, and
my Sunday School character. They’ve turned
me into a white-tusked Khalifa, bent on canning
Huns and catchin’ curios for the Shack
Valley girls.”</p>

<p>‘“All the married men of Shack Valley
who want to get quit of their wives ought to
book right here. There’s free passes up to the
Sudden Death Establishment, and a photo-man
to take your chivvy when you’re passing in
your checks. I’ve been near it, but the Devil
doesn’t want me yet. I’ve had my pants
blown clean away to Berlin, my sittin’-down
place peppered with shrapnel; the beef of my
legs is lyin’ up in Bapaume; and there’s blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
from my nose around La Bassée. I’ve been
choked with the Kaiser’s lavatory gas, and
got chucked to heaven one night along with
a horse and an automobile. Oh my, I did
want to go home!</p>

<p>‘“Still, it ain’t bad! I was made a lance-corporal
for rescuing the captain’s bottle of
whisky under a bombardment, and a full
corporal for collaring three pimple-headed
Huns who came over to ask me the time.
Why, I’m just real good at the butchering
business. I’ve got a jab-knife and a bludgeon
dotted with nails. When I’m bored stiff I
hops over, clubs a few German waiters on the
top knot, and brings back the latest news from
the Crown Prince’s doss-house behind the line.
They calls me ‘Butcher Bill,’ and stuck a tin
medal on my chest for flopping out a fat fellow
who wanted to take a lease of our front line.
Talk about pictures! Why, this is the best
picture-show out of Toronto.</p>

<p>‘“Oh, you can tell the boys they’ve given
me the Military Medal for doin’ a little job on
a dark night. It was dirty work at the cross-roads.
A fight for a hole&mdash;a shell-hole.
They wanted it, and we wanted it. So we
staked our pitch and said, ‘Come on.’ I cut a
pound o’ steak out o’ a German lootenant, and
made three widows in Potsdam. Had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
done! No Shack Valley boy’s goin’ to lie
down to them fellows. Oh, it’s a hellifa life!</p>

<p>‘“Now I’m in a school for officers. They
reckon Tosher is push-and-go stuff, and want
to rig me out as a big-gun in the fightin’
business. I ain’t at all keen, for you’ve got to
be respectable, and when you’re wearing one
pip, you’re barred from asking a lady, ‘Is this
the way to Bond Street?’ There’s a real
first-class crowd here&mdash;remittance men, cow-punchers,
log-rollers, grafters, and let-me-downs,
not forgetting sky-pilots and kids from
school. But they’re bright boys, and can jaw
on anything from eugenics to corn cure.
Why, it’s just good to think o’ the stuff that
wants the King’s commission. Some are all
‘side,’ and some need it. And they’re all
gaw-damn Tories, except one, and he’s a
lawyer. (I’m watchin’ this fellow.)</p>

<p>‘“They teaches me how to eat sardines
without using a knife, and how to chew an
orange without splashing my dial. And you
can bet your boots they show me how to do
the big salaams to the Great Boss. It’s a
wonderful business! When I get back I’ll
know how to wipe my feet on the mayor’s
mat. They call it ‘form,’ and they think we
wild fellows from Shack Valley are the
ruddiest lot of gum-chewing hobos that ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wore an army shirt and climbed up a gun.
But I’m givin’ them hot stuff, an’ teachin’
them that we from out West ain’t one-eyed
chicks from lop-brained Alabama.</p>

<p>‘“Still, it ain’t a bad institooshun, and the
girls round here are prime. I can get a kiss
for a maple-leaf, and a wife by giving a nod.</p>

<p>‘“Oh, boys, it’s a hellifa fine war! Give
Laurier a miss and come right over. The way
to heaven’s cheap, and all funeral expenses
paid.</p>

<p>‘“Besides, <i>the beer’s real good</i>.”’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE MODERN GIRL.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">In</span> peace or war we cannot do without the
ladies. They brighten this weary world,
cheer us when we are in the depths, and tend
us ‘when pain and anguish wring the brow.’
Our mothers mould our characters, our sisters
help to keep us clean, while other men’s sisters
provide the love and the inspiration so needful
to man. And war is good for the business of
Cupid. Danger gives admiration scope, and
promotes the deeper affection.</p>

<p>Adela was my star. When drill and lectures
were done, I basked in her smiles and played
the old, old game. But, like all women, she
loved to tease. It was, therefore, in keeping
with her character to send me the following:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘<span class="smcap">My dear Johnnie</span>,&mdash;Don’t come on Saturday,
as I shall be engaged. We are having two
Australians to lunch, and shall be busy all day.
You will understand. Love.</p>

<p class="pbqr4"><span class="smcap">Adela.</span>’</p>

<p class="p1">That was all she said. Two Australians!
I felt annoyed, for these Cornstalks are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
deadly rivals of the British Army. One of
them had stolen my little French girl in La
Bassée, while another had eloped with my
V.A.D. from a Strand hotel. No, it wasn’t
good enough, and I loudly swore.</p>

<p>‘What’s wrong, John?’ inquired Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Adela is booked for Saturday. The Anzacs
are cutting me out. I’m fed up!’</p>

<p>‘I’m in your boat too, old chap. Her sister
is apparently on the same stunt. She sent me
word this morning, but I am not worrying.
There’s lots of girls in this world. A little
change will do us good. I’m fed up being
respectable. Women <i>are</i> the limit. They’re
getting too sure of themselves. They’re like
trout&mdash;want a lot of playing before you land
them. There’s nothing like cold indifference
to bring them round.’</p>

<p>‘You’re an authority, Beefy.’</p>

<p>‘Well&mdash;yes. I’ve paid for my experience.
I’ve loved everything from a parlour-maid to
a general’s daughter. They’re all the same.
As Kipling says:</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">The colonel’s lady<br />
And Judy O’Grady<br />
Are sisters under their skin.</p>

<p class="p1">‘Pursue them, lavish the wealth of a
millionaire on them, yield them your life and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
soul, and they’ll go round the corner to&mdash;<i>the
other fellow</i>.</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">They’re contrary,<br />
And they’re wary;<br />
They’re devils till they die.’</p>

<p class="p1">‘You’re a cynic, Beefy. You’ve met the
wrong sort. You can’t expect barmaids and
ballet-girls to have souls. They trade their
charms and squander their affections, but the
real decent kind are not half-bad. I’ve a
weakness for the opposite sex.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you’re a ruddy idealist. You’re always
up in the moon. You’re too trusting. One
can’t trust a woman. If I had my way, I’d
go over to the system of the Moslems.’</p>

<p>‘You’re <i>blasé</i>, Beefy. You have had such
a good time that you think the world has gone
wrong. What’s the good of being a cynic?
I’m not posing, old chap, but I do think
there’s a lot of goodness in modern girls if
you care to search for it. Why, they’re
real sports! Look what they’re doing to win
the war. They’re nursing, driving, ploughing,
and cooking, without a grouse. It’s a great
revelation! This war has given them their
opportunity. You can’t put these girls into
harems after the war. Your mentality is
crooked, Beefy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Per-haps! All the same, I’m convinced
the modern girl is neurotic. I may be <i>blasé</i>
and all that, but I’d much sooner have the
steady old Mid-Victorian type than these
short-skirted creatures, who love a naval man
on Monday and elope with a soldier on Tuesday.
Seems to me they want only a good
time. A fellow with a Rolls-Royce has a
better chance than a man with a Ford.
Women judge you by your cheque-book.
They want to hook the fellow who can give
them everything from a pug-nosed poodle
to a collar of diamonds. They’re nearly all
adventuresses, and the only chap they understand
is the primitive one who spanks them
hard when they get into their tantrums.
Women are all right when they’re mastered.
We men are long-suffering, and much too
generous to the average girl.’</p>

<p>‘Love keeps a woman straight, Beefy.’</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;love and the whip. Force appeals
to women. They admire pugilists, and even
the most beautiful women like to marry big,
strong, ugly, powerful creatures&mdash;Neros rather
than Apollos. I tell you, John, that women
to-day are as primitive as Eve.’</p>

<p>‘You’re a jealous devil, Beefy. You want
your own way. Freedom apparently is made
for you, and not for the girl. I’m no great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Christian, but I do think if you trust a girl
she will always play the game.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, you’re a blinkin’ ass!’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Adela has just told you not to come to-day,
as she is busy with the Anzacs. And yet you
talk about trust!’</p>

<p>‘That’s true. Still, on reflection, it would
be an impertinence for us to warn all the other
fellows off the track. If I’m annoyed, I’m
not going to be narrow-minded about it.
Besides, I’m not engaged to the girl. I’ve
an open mind so far as a mate is concerned.
I’m simply looking around, and I won’t
endorse your barbarian creeds. Why, Beefy,
you’re almost a Hun where the other sex is
concerned. Come on, you silly old ass; let’s
go and get some fresh air,’</p>

<p>‘All right, John Bunyan,’ mumbled Beefy,
shoving on his cap and sauntering out of the
camp.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>We took a train to the nearest town,
a manufacturing place, alive with munition-girls
and other war-workers. As we ambled
along we had time to observe the manners
and methods of the crowd. A healthy Amazon
gave us ‘the glad eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘There, John, didn’t I tell you they’re as
primitive as in the Bronze Age?’</p>

<p>‘That’s just the fun of the uneducated.
Hang it all! I thought you rather liked that
sort of thing.’</p>

<p>‘That’s not the point. What I want to prove
is this. You can “pick up” almost every girl
in this street. These girls are man-mad.’</p>

<p>‘You judge by superficial things. Of course,
there may be a little in what you say; but
you must remember that men now and after
the war will be scarce in the marriage-market.
I’m sorry for all the nice girls who are being
left on the perch. As for the lady who
smiled, she doesn’t represent her sex. You
know it, too, but you are simply bent on
“chewing the rag.” You’re a fat-headed
old’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Excuse me,’ said a sweet-faced girl at that
moment, touching my arm.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I answered, a little abashed.</p>

<p>‘Are you in the Cadet Battalion at Windmoor?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I replied more pleasantly, observing
how charming she and her companion looked.
Beefy was grinning like a nigger.</p>

<p>‘I wonder if you could give this note to
your fellow-cadet, Robert Clarke.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Nobby Clarke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you call him “Nobby.”’</p>

<p>‘Certainly&mdash;delighted! May I have the
pleasure of telling him the name of the
sender?’</p>

<p>‘His sister&mdash;Marjory. I do hope you will
excuse my asking you, but I want him to
come to-morrow for tea, and I thought I
should meet somebody from the camp. I was
rather nervous about stopping you, for you
appeared so engrossed in some discussion.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we were discussing girls. My friend
here is a bit of a cynic.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t believe him,’ interjected Beefy.</p>

<p>‘I think you are all very gay at the Cadet
School. Now, will you excuse me? My sister
and I have to go on to hospital. We’re
V.A.D.’s, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t go yet,’ pleaded Beefy. ‘I
wonder if we may ask you to tea at the
picture-house.’</p>

<p>‘It’s hardly conventional, is it?’</p>

<p>‘But it’s war-time, Miss Clarke, and of
course&mdash;we know your brother. He will be
quite pleased, I am sure.’</p>

<p>‘That sounds consoling to my conscience.’
Then, turning, she called her sister Hilda over,
and away we went to the tea-rooms.</p>

<p>They were well-educated and most charming
girls, and Marjory dispensed tea like a duchess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Do tell me, Mr Brown, what you two were
fighting about when I stopped you.’</p>

<p>‘A simple matter. Beefy, here, was saying
women are neurotic and cheap these days.
I took a brief in defence of your sex&mdash;that’s
all.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Jones is saucy, I think,’ muttered
Marjory, just as she was about to put her
pretty teeth into a cherry-cake.</p>

<p>‘Per-haps; but don’t you think you girls
get it all your own way these days?’ answered
Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Yes, after thousands of years of bondage.
It was surely time to break the shackles.
We’ve been cooped up like canaries. There’s
a big difference between freedom and folly.
I don’t think the average girl makes a mess
of things. Ours is not the easy path you
think, Mr Jones. Why shouldn’t we do things?
We can’t all get married, so we have to carve
out our careers. If we do have our innocent
pleasures, I think we work mighty hard for
them, especially in war-time.’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but aren’t you girls a fickle lot?’</p>

<p>‘That depends on the sort of girl. Many
of you boys chase powdered creatures, who are
as brainless as they are hopeless. They are
the moths who rush at every bright candle,
but they don’t represent the nice girls in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
provinces or away in the decent West-End
homes. These stupid girls are getting our
sex a bad name. You boys are so silly.&mdash;Do
have more tea,’ she said, peering into Beefy’s
cup.</p>

<p>‘Thanks&mdash;I will.’</p>

<p>‘I think you boys learn a lot of nonsense
when you go to public schools. Some schools
have a rotten atmosphere. You dabble in
Wilde and Zola, and feed yourselves on
Oriental and degenerate trash. What you
want is fresh air and plenty of tennis or golf
with real nice girls! You won’t get the best
of our sex at stage-doors or in saloon-bars.
And that’s where many boys form their views.
However, we’ve got the vote, and we’ll help
you through. Have a cherry-cake.’</p>

<p>‘Come, come, Miss Clarke! You’re not all
saints; you know that.’</p>

<p>‘Granted, Mr Jones. But what about the
men? Don’t you think there are faults on
both sides? The world was never perfect,
and never will be, but it’s silly to abuse each
other. Come now, let’s be friends. You’re
much too nice to have those silly cynical views.
I really think you’re just arguing the point.’</p>

<p>‘Not exactly. Just look at the bunch of
girls around us here. They’ve got bags of
flour on their faces, red paint all over their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
lips, and they <i>do</i> fancy themselves. They’ll
pick up anything in trousers.’</p>

<p>‘These are the drones, not the busy bees.
All the best girls, like the best boys, are
helping to win the war. They haven’t time
to idle all day here. But the average man
is a queer creature. He doesn’t want a
“W.A.A.C.,” a “Wren,” or even a humbly
dressed “V.A.D.” They haven’t got enough
frills or fripperies. When he gets his leave
he hobnobs with the girl slackers. After a
day he is disillusioned; then he turns round
on the sex. You men are so inconsistent.
You want the lilies, but you always grasp the
deadly nightshades. Do have another cake.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, well, you’re different,’ mumbled Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Thanks&mdash;but I’m really “feeding the
brute.” You boys want mothering. It
doesn’t do to let you have it all your own
way. The world, somehow, has gone mad.
This war is making all of us catty. It’s
much nicer to be chummy, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think you are right on the chummy
point.’</p>

<p>‘Good! You’re really not so pagan as I
imagined. At first I thought you were a wild
man of the woods.’</p>

<p>‘I thought girls preferred that kind.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps; but they’re not reliable. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I believe the average girl likes a blend of the
saint and the sinner.’</p>

<p>‘You women are certainly a mystery.’</p>

<p>‘To a man&mdash;yes. That’s our armour. You
are all so fickle that we daren’t put all our
goods in the window. You’re really better
when on the end of a string and kept in
suspense. It stops you chasing our rivals.
Women have no use for polygamy. When we
find a good thing we hang on to it.’</p>

<p>‘We’re certainly not so subtle as women.’</p>

<p>‘That’s easily explained. You are the
hunter; we are the hunted. We need a lot of
tricks to dodge you. For all that, a woman
is quite simple. What she really craves for is
affection. That’s what she is here for; give
her that and she’ll give you the moon.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you’re a marvel.’</p>

<p>‘No; I’m only a girl.’</p>

<p>‘But other girls don’t talk like you.’</p>

<p>‘More’s the pity! You men are so scarce
that girls frequently sink opinions and principles
to catch you. It’s really not worth the
trouble. There are more things in heaven
and earth than chocolates or trousers. Why
should a girl let a man be the great I-Am?
It’s not good for him! It makes him a Turk!
Equality of intellect and opportunity is surely
reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘By Jove! I believe you’re a suffragette.’</p>

<p>‘Why not? You’ve had it all your own
way for centuries. You’ve flooded the world
with materialism. There <i>are</i> better things.
Surely you don’t want us to be German Fraus&mdash;fat
frumps, exclusively absorbed in cooking,
kids, and kirks. You need Idealism. Girls
have more of it than men. And it’s your
pagan code that’s really upset our sex.
You’d sooner have omelet than love.’</p>

<p>‘But we must have omelets.’</p>

<p>‘Omelets, without love, are like chickens
without breasts. You don’t want a woman
simply to preside over jam-jars. If the German
women had only asserted themselves
there would never have been a war.’</p>

<p>‘Explain.’</p>

<p>‘You must know that German women were
locked in their kitchens, trained to prostrate
themselves at the feet of man, and squashed
when they asserted the sweeter and more reasonable
philosophy which women have been given,
so as to neutralise the barbarism of the world.’</p>

<p>‘There’s something in that, I grant you,’
conceded Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Now you are really coming round.’</p>

<p>‘You are such a good advocate, you know.
But I never thought pretty girls like you
could be suffragettes. You don’t need to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Heavens! What a thought! Must a suffragette
have flat feet and a pug-nose? It
isn’t really a question of votes; it’s a question
of broadening out our philosophy and making
the world more happy. There will be no more
Hohenzollerns once we take a hand in the
legislation of the world.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll vote for you&mdash;by Jove, I will!’</p>

<p>‘How nice of you!’ said Marjory, smiling
sweetly and collecting her umbrella, gloves, &amp;c.</p>

<p>‘Must you go?’ I asked regretfully. The
discussion had been so interesting.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes; we’re on duty at four. Now,
good-bye, Mr Brown.&mdash;Good-bye, Mr Jones.’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye. Oh, by the way’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘Will you come to tea again?’</p>

<p>‘Delighted.... Good-bye.’ And away she
and her sister went&mdash;a couple of dream-pictures
in the garb of the V.A.D.</p>

<p>As they disappeared I turned to Beefy and
said, ‘Well, old chap, what about women
now?’</p>

<p>‘Marvellous! Marvellous!’</p>

<p>I thought so too, for I had been thinking
hard about Adela.</p>

<p>Was she flirting with the Australians?</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="pch">PSYCHOLOGY.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">‘What’s</span> the stunt to-day?’ inquired
Ginger one wet morning.</p>

<p class="pn">‘Lecture,’ I answered.</p>

<p class="pn">‘What on?’</p>

<p>‘Psychology.’</p>

<p>‘A precious lot of psychology we’ll get in
this school. They know as much about it as
they do about Mars. I’m fed up with these
army lecturers. They make me sick. They’re
parrots, and all cribbing from one another.’</p>

<p>‘But this is a new man.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, we’ll give him a hearing,’ said
Ginger, picking up his notebook and sauntering
over to the lecture-room.</p>

<p>What Ginger said was partly true, for many
of the lecturers bored us stiff. A few of them
were dug-outs who got their theories of modern
war from the daily papers. Others were well-meaning
men, but often they lacked originality.
Army training had repressed their individuality,
and they were apparently afraid to break conventions.
When a good man did come along
the dead-heads seemed to get jealous, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
brilliant rebel quietly disappeared. The army
will not be an army proper till jealousy is
made bad form.</p>

<p>When we had assembled, Captain Cheerall
entered briskly, looked at us&mdash;and&mdash;smiled.
A good beginning! We decided not to sleep,
but to plumb his depths.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen, you may smoke, if you like.
I find it breeds a friendly feeling.’</p>

<p>‘Good chap!’ mumbled Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Now that all your chimneys are going, I
want to have a chat with you about Psychology;
but before I start, let me say to you&mdash;don’t
hesitate to pull me up if you disagree.
Ask as many questions as you like, for I
loathe the ancient method which places the
lecturer on the pedestal of a mandarin, and
forces facts down unwilling throats.’</p>

<p>‘The goods!’ I whispered.</p>

<p>‘Psychology, in brief, is the science which
classifies and analyses the phenomena of the
human mind. As an old army officer, I regret
to say we knew precious little about it before
the war. Some of the Staff College men had
it as a side-line. Haking, in his somewhat
rambling book on <i>Company Training</i>, struck
the first intelligent notes on the subject.
Colonel Fuller of the “Ox and Bucks” tried
to drag it into the arena of military training.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Here and there an isolated enthusiast worked
out his own pet theories. But, broadly speaking,
our army knew nothing about it. The
French Army, however, was more progressive.
Several French officers had produced excellent
books on the subject prior to 1914. And in
the French military academies psychology was
a term well known to every student. Germany
also worked at it, but not so effectively as
France. Many of the Russian generals, such
as Brussiloff, the Grand Duke, and Alexeieff,
were keen students of the science.</p>

<p>‘Why, then, did we know little about it?
The answer is this. We are a conservative
people. We are mentally lazy. We resent
new ideas, mainly because they disturb our
happy old ways. Let us admit our faults, for
it is the negation of all sound work to cover
up errors in military training.</p>

<p>‘Psychology is not so difficult as people
think. Professors make it difficult when they
ramble off into bewildering scientific phenomena
instead of getting down to earth. This game
is really a study of what the other fellow is
thinking; how his thoughts affect his actions;
and the sum total of his intellectual output.
You do not require to be a university don to
grip its essentials. Common-sense, ordinary
intelligence, and organised study will give you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the rudiments. And no man has a better
opportunity to exploit the science than the
army officer. He commands all types, all
creeds. In his daily work he is rubbing against
the efficient and the inefficient, the alert and
the lethargic, the successful and the failure.
If you, as future officers, will make it your
duty to observe the mental meanderings of
your units, you will quickly discover the
road to high command. By knowing your
men, you can handle them. By classifying and
treating them as mere units, you will eventually
cause anything from a mutiny to a disaster in
face of the enemy.</p>

<p>‘All of you, I hope, will shortly command
platoons. You will then have sixty men to
rule. You will find your job easy or difficult,
according to your ability tactfully to enforce
your orders, to create in the minds of your
men the belief that you are a more powerful
personality, and to get out of all ranks the
maximum of work with the minimum of friction.
Take an example. When I entered this room
I did so in a very alert manner. That was
not accidental; it was deliberate. I was
determined to impress on you that I was no
straggler. Next, I reached this desk, then
smiled. Why? To make you feel you were
not dealing with a ferocious martinet who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
uses his rank to enforce his orders and opinions.
Thirdly, I said you could smoke. This suggestion
smashed any remaining vestige of rank
or distinction, so far as this actual lecture is
concerned. <i>I came here to get at you.</i>’</p>

<p>‘You’ve got us, sir,’ said Ginger.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ he answered, amidst laughter.
‘To carry this particular argument to its final
conclusion, let me say I do not know the
gentleman who said, “You’ve got us, sir,” but,
from his appearance, I imagine he is an intellectual,
bored stiff with military formalities,
and regards me as a Heaven-sent Harry Lauder
to cheer him up.’ (Loud laughter.)</p>

<p>‘Your laughter, gentlemen, I accept, not as
a mere compliment, but as evidence of a
mental sympathy. In brief, we now understand
each other. And that is the basis of
good work and military efficiency. Therefore,
when you get command of your platoons, this
will be your first duty. <i>Know your men.</i></p>

<p>‘When I say you must know your men, I do
not mean that you should disregard any of the
regulations laid down for the personal conduct
of an officer. Stupid familiarity breeds contempt.
If you start addressing the sergeant
as “old chap,” the corporal as “Bill,” and a
man as “Tommy,” your prestige will fall to
zero, and your men will regard you as a priceless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
buffoon! On the other hand, there is
absolutely no need to be a snob, a martinet, or
an autocrat. A martinet is a man of limited
intellect, afraid of his own inferior knowledge.
An autocrat is usually a bully like the Kaiser.
My tip is, to act the part of a quiet and
courteous British gentleman, with just a
suggestion of reserve to frighten off a cad who
desires to exploit your very good nature. But
your greatest asset is knowledge. Ability
engenders respect. Tact retains respect.
And psychology enables you to exploit that
respect in the very best interests of His
Majesty’s Service.</p>

<p>‘Let us still keep to the platoon. The first
man you will meet will be the platoon
sergeant. Supposing you have mastered this
science of the mind, and your knowledge
enables you to see that the sergeant is, by
temperament, what the Scots call “dour;” he
may also be quick-tempered, inclined to resent
criticism&mdash;in short, “touchy.” Now you are
up against something. You must remember
that temperament is either hereditary or the
result of environment. Again, you may discover
that this man is otherwise an excellent
soldier. Your acquaintance with psychology
will immediately suggest to you that your
sergeant will have to be handled with kid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
gloves, even to the extent of openly conceding
a point now and again to his little
whims. That is common-sense. No sergeant
is perfect, and no officer is perfect; and it
would be the height of folly and presumption
for any new subaltern to give an otherwise
excellent N.C.O. a dog’s life. Be patient,
well-meaning, and courteous, and in a month’s
time the sergeant will, metaphorically, lick
your boots.</p>

<p>‘There are other N.C.O.’s in the platoon.
In our present-day armies, as you know, these
non-coms. are frequently men of social standing,
and&mdash;more important&mdash;men of character.
Degrees are as common as peas in the ranks
to-day. All are open-eyed and certainly
democratic. Such men are sensitive. But
they are <i>not</i> Bolsheviks. They are intensely
critical, but equally patriotic. They have
only one standard of measurement&mdash;BRAINS.
This is an embarrassing situation to an officer
who is simply “a son of his father”&mdash;nothing
more. But it is not at all a bad atmosphere
for a gentleman of culture, vigour, and enthusiasm.
Certainly there is a demand for
the higher qualities of leadership. To a keen
soldier this is a most glorious incentive. You
will not succeed unless your will, your personality,
and your merits are predominant. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
have got to be top-dog. But you must never
obtrude your rank as the badge of that right.
To go on parade with the feeling that there
is a guardroom behind you to enforce your
whims and ill-balanced opinions is madness.
The guardroom is really meant for the criminal
and the hopeless fool. Knowing your job and
knowing your men will really result in less
crime, less discontent, and the creation of a
happy and efficient unit. This aim is perfectly
easy to a student of psychology, provided he
has the will which springs from health and
broad-based culture.</p>

<p>‘Another important point. When your
company commander desires to make new
N.C.O.’s, he will, if he knows his job, consult
you as to the best men in your platoon. Here
you must be careful. The unthinking and
brainless sub. is frequently attracted by
shallow and insincere qualities. A man who
soft-soaps his fads and carries “tales” may
strike him as “a ripping chap&mdash;just the man
for the stripe.” On the other hand, a good
officer’s servant, a successful regimental policeman,
or an obliging company clerk may figure
high in his estimation, to the detriment of
other men possessed of <span class="smcap">CHARACTER</span>, <span class="smcap">EDUCATION</span>,
and <span class="smcap">DETERMINATION</span>. To pass these men by is
to commit a great offence against efficiency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Indeed, if ten thousand stupid subalterns
selected ten thousand stupid individuals as
platoon sergeants, and these N.C.O.’s were all
together in a great push, what would happen?
<span class="smcap">Disaster!</span></p>

<p>‘I am not here to frighten you; but I am
here to kill that damnably dangerous theory
that platoon drill, and nothing more, is all a
soldier requires to know. We have had
enough of this fetich. We are fighting the
Germans. They are no fools. Unless you
realise the serious responsibility of your high
office, you are utterly useless for the Service.</p>

<p>‘Again, you will have to father, guide,
train, and lead the men&mdash;the glorious <span class="smcap">MEN</span>.
I hope you will not regard this as “a beastly
bore,” but as a privilege. The men who died
at Mons, who leapt forward from the Marne,
who barred the gates at Ypres, and stemmed
disaster at Cambrai are no servile, cringing
crew. They are Cavaliers and&mdash;<span class="smcap">GENTLEMEN</span>.
Remember that! Open out your heart, but
keep your head. You will find in your
platoons dukes’ sons and cooks’ sons, aspiring
generals&mdash;and some ruddy fools. Occasionally
you may strike a desperado&mdash;a man who does
not give a tinker’s curse for officers, cells, or a
firing-squad. When you run across this type
you must go easy. A wrong word, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
man may spring from the ranks and strike you
down. And it is here that psychology comes
to your aid. Study the man from all angles,
and you will discover some little thing which
touches his real soul. It may be a little act
of kindness. For example, I once had a man
who had knifed a policeman in civil life. He
was a desperado. The N.C.O.’s were afraid of
him. They could do nothing with him except
chuck him in the guardroom. This made him
worse, and I was really afraid of his committing
murder. One day when out walking
I met him alone on the road. I did not
expect him to salute me. But he did. So
I said, “Well, Smith, are you having a
walk?”</p>

<p>‘“Yes, sir, away from the&mdash;&mdash; misery.
I’m fed up and nearly off my chump. I’ll
desert.”</p>

<p>‘“Have a cigarette,” I answered.</p>

<p>‘“Thanks,” he grunted, but a little flicker
in his eyes suggested surprise. Very tactfully
I led him out into the country, talking about
anything and everything till we struck the top
of a mound. This, as you know, was quite an
unusual procedure for an officer; but I was
dealing with a desperate man, and I was going
to have no murder in my company.</p>

<p>‘“Sit down, Smith,” I suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>‘“I think I will,” he grunted.</p>

<p>‘I gave him another cigarette, and in twenty
minutes’ time he was in a most friendly mood.
His brutality&mdash;which was really superficial&mdash;was
melting.</p>

<p>‘“Now, Smith, I’m your company commander.
What’s the trouble? Let’s have
it out, man to man. They say you loathe the
army and hate your officers.”</p>

<p>‘“That’s a&mdash;&mdash; lie, sir. I don’t hate my
officers.”</p>

<p>‘“What is it, then?”</p>

<p>‘“I hate Sergeant B&mdash;&mdash;. He’s a swine.
He rags me. I’ll murder him!” he shouted.
There was an ungovernable madness in his
eyes.</p>

<p>‘“Steady, Smith,” I said. “Let’s talk
quietly. Have another cigarette.”</p>

<p>He took one, and his gust of passion passed
away.</p>

<p>‘“Then you are either going to commit a
murder or desert; is that it?”</p>

<p>‘“Exactly, sir. I’ve nothing against you.
You’ve been hard, but square. I’ve got my
dues. When I’m wrong I takes my punishment.
I likes my officers; but I hates the&mdash;&mdash;
sergeants, specially Sergeant B&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<p>‘Now, this Sergeant B&mdash;&mdash; was a good
soldier, but he could not tell the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
between an undergraduate and a ploughman.
He used men like machines, and had given
me a lot of trouble. At the same time, Smith
was no Christian. Yet, somehow, I felt all
his offences resulted from misdirected energy.
So I said, “Look here, Smith; you’ll go
back to barracks. And to-night you must
declare a truce between yourself and your so-called
enemies. To-morrow morning you will
come and see me at the company orderly-room,
when I shall have an interesting proposition
to put before you. Will you do so?”</p>

<p>‘“Yes, sir,” he grunted, after a long pause.</p>

<p>‘I left him to wander back to barracks.
Next morning he turned up shaved, boots
shining, and buttons cleaned. I checked my
expression of surprise and opened out.</p>

<p>‘“Now, Smith, I’ve been diagnosing your
case. You’re over-healthy and naturally mischievous.
Your hatred for sergeants is really
jealousy. I think in some things you are a
strong-minded man. In short, you want to
lead, and not to be led. If I could get inside
your brain-pot I might discover a lurking
ambition to be an N.C.O. and throw your
weight about.”</p>

<p>‘He burst out laughing, and I felt I had
got him.</p>

<p>‘“To-night you will appear in orders as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
lance-corporal, and you will be transferred to
Sergeant Jones’s platoon. I shall expect you
to go to school to improve your education.
And here is a week-end pass to celebrate your
good fortune. Finally, Smith, I hope to God
you will never be before me again, for crime
in my company breaks my heart. I’m treating
you as a gentleman. And I’m quite sure you
will always be one. Fall out, please.”</p>

<p>‘Smith saluted like a Guardsman, turned
about, and ceased to be a public nuisance.</p>

<p>‘<i>Sergeant-Major Smith died at Mons.</i>’</p>

<p>When the lecturer finished this anecdote, a
terrific cheering burst from all the school, and
there was just a suggestion of something dim
about the lecturer’s eyes. He was thinking of
how Sergeant-Major Smith had held up a
whole German battalion when all his officers
were wiped out.</p>

<p>‘I hope you will excuse my giving you this
story of Smith. But, really, that is better
than all the pamphlets on psychology. Smith
might have ended up on the gallows. Instead
of that, he died as a warrant-officer and a hero.
You will now see how important it is to study
the human mind. And I hold that if you can
master the mental meandering of your platoons,
you may rightly aspire to the General Staff.
When you are a G.S.O., <i>III.</i>, <i>II.</i>, or <i>I.</i>, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
will realise what platoons, companies, regiments,
and brigades <i>can</i> do, and will <i>never</i> issue orders
likely to cause discontent and endanger our
<i>moral</i>.</p>

<p>‘Now, the psychology of your own army is
an important thing, but the psychology of the
enemy is doubly important. We are up against
a most cunning, brutal, and ungentlemanly foe.
Great victories can be secured only by clever
reading of enemy thought, and astute counter-tactics.
Take the battle of the Marne. Joffre
brilliantly defeated the Germans, <i>not</i> by superior
man or gun power, but by superior strategy,
based on a correct reading of the enemy’s
power, vanity, and historical beliefs. In this
work we also assisted. The Germans were
stupid enough to believe that Lord French
would throw the B.E.F. into Belgium. This
was the German scheme and their dream.
Lord French declined the bait, and the Germans
lost precious days before they found out
their stupid analysis of our psychology. As
for Joffre, he certainly had no intention (originally)
to fight it out at the Marne, but the
blunder of a French general before Namur
compelled him to select this field. His retirement
was a glorious trick in which he pandered
to the Paris dream of Von Kluck, tickled the
enveloping theories of the Crown Prince, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
drugged the whole German nation&mdash;Kaiser
and all&mdash;into the belief that the end of France
was near. Time and again he resisted tempting
opportunities for a general action, till the
Marne was reached. Then, when the German
General Staff was drunk with victory,
when their line was lengthened, their munitionment
and rationing tedious and difficult,
their troops tired with their hitherto magnificent
marching, he launched his blow&mdash;faulty
in parts, but staggering and effective as a
whole. With a <i>crash</i> he killed the Paris
dream. With a <i>bound</i> he swept corps after
corps of the hardest-trained troops in the
world into a tragic rout and irredeemable
disaster. The Marne was the defeat of Germany.
Since then they have simply been
fighting for terms. And this glorious victory,
for which we ought to thank our God, was
helped immensely by the ability to read the
enemy’s mind, and the refusal to accept <i>his</i>
preconceived theories of the Allies’ action in
such a war.</p>

<p>‘Since the Marne we have improved. Take
Byng’s thrust at Cambrai. For three years
we used preliminary bombardments before
making a great assault. And at Cambrai the
enemy <i>knew</i> of our coming attack. <i>But he
waited for our bombardment.</i> Instead of that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Byng’s men took up their beds&mdash;and walked
for miles into the enemy’s lines. This was
entirely unexpected, and therefore successful.
Byng, I say, is a most excellent student of
psychology.</p>

<p>‘But we must also admit that the enemy
has improved. At Cambrai we massed our
reserves <i>in the centre</i> to meet the counter-attack
which would be launched in accordance with
<i>known</i> German tactics. The Germans, however,
discovered the weakness of both of our
flanks, and struck sledge-hammer blows. Had
it not been for the supreme courage of the
Guards, of London and Highland Territorials,
Cambrai might have been the funeral of our
High Command. This proves that we have
no monopoly of psychology.</p>

<p>‘While I ask you to respect and never underrate
the power of the enemy, do not fear the
enemy. And do not believe he is superior.
The German clings with frenzied energy to
trench warfare. He is afraid of the open&mdash;afraid
of the British and the French in open
man&oelig;uvre. He remembers the Marne. He
remembers the Russian push into north Germany,
the success of Brussiloff in Galicia, the
brilliant strategy of Maude, and the glorious
work of Allenby and Smuts. In open warfare
we can beat the German to a frazzle because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
our mental alacrity, willingness to scrap original
orders, and to adapt ourselves to sudden and
unexpected onslaughts. The German is a
worker, a thruster, and a courageous fellow;
but a mere handful of troops, with only
shrapnel and bayonets, held up one million
Huns at Ypres. Lord French outman&oelig;uvred
the enemy there. Ypres was the grave of
German Push-and-Go.</p>

<p>‘<i>The German is helpless in open warfare.</i></p>

<p>‘The enemy is not afraid of shells or bayonet,
but he is afraid of superior intelligence. The
camouflage of Allied military thought is more
distressing to Germany than lyddite or gas.
Our naval policy in refusing to disclose the
facts about the number of German submarines
sunk, and <i>how</i> we have sunk them, is destroying
the <i>moral</i> of the German Navy. Our
counter-propaganda is smashing his propaganda.
While he may console himself with the Russian
Revolution, he is suffering the fires of hell from
the intervention of America. This suffering
is easily explained. The American brain is
the most resourceful, the most subtle, the most
deadly in the world. I am speaking commercially,
of course. No Von Kühlmann, Ballin,
Hindenburg, or Von Boy-ed can master it.
The American discovery and exposure of the
German plot in Mexico was a masterly feat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
in intelligence. The use of German ships
to transport American troops to France is
a business-like answer to Germany’s submarine
campaign. The prompt organisation
of an American Propaganda Department in
Switzerland, to inform the enemy&mdash;<i>free of
charge</i>&mdash;about his impending doom, is excellent.
Ford’s creation of anti-submarine boats,
which are being turned out like sausages, will
stagger the gentlemen of Kiel. In short, the
American knows the German. American aid
is the death of Germany, in the military,
political, and commercial sense of the term.
And the entry of America, like our own entry
into this war, was due to faulty German psychology,
a stupid reading of the national mind,
failure to understand the spirit and soul of
America&mdash;as of Britain&mdash;as well as blind reliance
on bluff, bombast, rapine, terror, corruption,
and assassination for the intimidation of
neutrals.</p>

<p>‘<i>The Allies are more intelligent than the
Germans.</i></p>

<p>‘Now, gentlemen, I have shown you the
tremendous importance of psychology, in the
work of platoons, regiments, armies, and embassies.
You must study the subject. You
don’t need to go to Oxford. You can do it
in your own hut. Look at your neighbour!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Study his face, his eyes, his talk, his facial
expressions and physical actions. Watch him
at work. See whether he slacks or pulls,
fights or funks, tells the truth or dodges the
truth. You will feel at sea for a long time,
but in the end your eye and brain will enable
you to see the hero and the fool, and instinctively
to sense the coming thought or action
of an opponent. Psychology gives you the
wisdom of the old, the touch of the blind, the
sense of the tried, and a general strength which
is irresistible. This gift will enable you to
create an uncomfortable apprehension in the
mind of the enemy&mdash;a sense of something
tragic; a feeling that there are bombs under
the earth and above the earth; that <i>something</i>
which destroys the nerves of the German
nation and the German High Command.</p>

<p>‘That’s all, gentlemen,’ he concluded.</p>

<p>We gave him a mighty cheer.</p>

<p>‘Oh, by the way, any questions?’ he ejaculated.</p>

<p>No one got up. All seemed satisfied; but
just as he was turning away, Ginger Thomson
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>‘Sir.’</p>

<p>‘Yes?’</p>

<p>‘I want to tell you something. Before we
came in here we were arguing the point about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
rotten lectures and rotten lecturers. But I
feel we owe you much. You have helped us
a lot. We all hope you will come again, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Delighted! Oh, by the way, I missed a

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE VALUE OF SPORT.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">It</span> all started in a simple way. We were
sitting about the hut, smoking and reading,
when Beefy blew in with the information that
he had managed to get the company officer to
challenge B Company (our deadly rivals) to a
cross-country run next day.</p>

<p>‘Are they taking it on?’ asked Ginger.</p>

<p>‘You bet they are. And I hope we knock
lumps off them. They are a lousy lot; always
swinging the lead about being top-dogs. It’s
up to us to squash them.’</p>

<p>‘You ought to be pole-axed,’ muttered
Ginger.</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t we got enough to do without
plugging for ten miles through mud, brambles,
cows’ dung, and water? If you’d develop
your old fat head, you’d do better. Cross-country
run&mdash;confound you!’ and he hit Beefy
with a barrack pillow.</p>

<p>‘Silly ass! You’re a book-sucking hog.
You want a run to shake your liver up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Every blessed thing that comes up, you veto
it. Why can’t you follow the crowd?’</p>

<p>‘That’s for you, with your Clapham instincts
and shallow brain. You think Rugger and
such like the be-all and end-all of our existence.
Sport was invented only to keep down
your adipose tissue and turn you into a decent
citizen. I’ve got beyond that. Joseph Conrad
will do me to-morrow. I’m not on for your
“follow the crowd” business.’</p>

<p>All this talk, although it sounds hostile, was
not really so. It was that frank byplay so
characteristic of the army. Ginger regarded
Beefy as an over-healthy animal, only fit for
Rugger and philandering; while Beefy held
the view that Ginger’s physical laziness was a
menace to the company and the Empire. In
short, Beefy was all sport and Ginger was all
books. Each was a champion in that controversy
which threatens to remodel our present
public school system.</p>

<p>‘Come on, boys,’ I said; ‘gather round the
fire and let’s have this out. Is Beefy right or
wrong?’</p>

<p>‘He is, and he isn’t,’ said Billy Greens,
looking up from his beautifully kept notebook.
‘When he talks about beating B Company
I’m with him. But behind it all is that insane
idea that games make the superman, and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
who won’t play are damned. Sport is all right
in its own place.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear, old Pieface!’ commented Ginger.</p>

<p>‘It’s like this, boys,’ said Nobby Clarke.
‘Beefy is an ass, in the mental sense of the
term. And he knows it. He’s hanging on
to this Games Committee job for all he’s
worth. His whole reasoning is this: “The
company commander is an old Blue. If I
[Beefy] can’t pull through with my headpiece,
I’ll pull through with my zest for games.”
And he’ll do it, for the old commandant
believes in sportsmen. Beefy will make a
jolly good sub., but a rotten general. He will
carry out any order, and his rude health might
even get him the V.C., but he couldn’t give
an intelligent order to save his life. He’s a
prize-fighter, not an officer. After the war
you’ll see him as a chucker-out at a pub., or
throwing cannon-balls about the music-hall
stage.’</p>

<p>‘That’s your rotten Nonconformist creed,’
shouted Beefy. ‘You got that in one of those
suburban schools where they breed lawyers,
Radicals, and Socialists. You can’t see any
good in the public school system. I’m not a
saint, I know; but I do things in the light,
and am not afraid to talk about them. You’re
a measly Covenanter. You couldn’t do ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
miles at a trot to save your old face. But you
<i>can</i> argue the point, and pose as a moralist.
I know your type. If games have made me
a healthy animal, I rejoice. I can take my
punishment. Nobby, you’re a ruddy fool.’</p>

<p>‘Question!’ ejaculated Tosher.</p>

<p>‘Oh! Here’s this “gaw-damned” materialist
again,’ remarked Ginger maliciously.</p>

<p>‘These two beauties [Ginger and Beefy] are
wash-outs. One’s from Oxford; the other’s
from Cambridge. Oxford has made Ginger
into a cock-eyed wowser, and Cambridge has
turned Beefy into a base-ball looney. Ginger
couldn’t sell ham, and Beefy can’t write a
decent letter. One’s all Homer; the other’s
all beef. Out there [Canada] these fellows
don’t cut ice. They can’t work, and they
won’t work. You can see them with their
tongues hanging out in Calgary saloons, or
cow-punching on Armour’s beef-canning
stations. They ain’t soft, but they ain’t wise.
They’re all right in dress-suits doing the fox-trot,
but in dungarees&mdash;why, they just make
me smile. And this prime cup of oxo [Beefy]
has got a lien on sport, but I’d get a bush-whacking
kid to lick him soft at wrestling, and
knock him sick at running. You’re all jaw
and no push in this gaw-damned island.’</p>

<p>‘Now, I wonder if you’re right,’ said Billy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
closing his notebook with a snap and jumping
up.</p>

<p>‘I guess so.’</p>

<p>‘Give him fits, old Pieface,’ shouted Ginger.</p>

<p>‘What are your qualifications to act as
judge?’</p>

<p>‘I’m nootral, and they make us wise out
West.’</p>

<p>‘But you’ve only seen the froth of things,
and not the substance. Ginger isn’t Oxford,
and Beefy isn’t Cambridge. Ten minutes in the
Old Country doesn’t confer the right to shake
us up and blow traditions into smithereens.’</p>

<p>‘Tradition’s all moonshine, Billy.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps; but all your grain-lumpers and
pork-packers come here for wives and knighthoods.
You’d sell your soul to sleep in
Buckingham Palace, and pawn your trousers
to eat with the Cecils.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly,’ said Tosher, ‘if we wanted to
push through a twenty-thousand-dollar deal.’</p>

<p>‘But aren’t we sportsmen? That’s the point.’</p>

<p>‘Sure! But sport won’t pay the rent or
win the war, old child. You can’t kill Huns
with hockey-sticks, or use tennis-balls in a
barrage. Horse-sense and push-an’-go is a
live scheme. You’re real good, real kind;
but it makes me tired to see the nootrals
selling your grub to the Kaiser, and using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
your papers to get the plans of the latest push.
You ain’t wise over here.’</p>

<p>‘And what’s good about us? Anything?’</p>

<p>‘Your soul. It’s as clean as the brook, and
true as Lincoln. You’re fools; but you ain’t
willing fools. You’re old; but yet you’re
green. This island is a happy hunting-ground
for Jews, Germans, and assassins. But we
can’t see you fall. The Old Land is Our Land.
It’s the Old Home, Billy, and that’s why
I’m in. God help the Huns when I go out!
I’ll go “West” before this land goes “West.”
But, say, I’ve got to go. I’m dining with a
real live lord. He wants to see a bucking
broncho from the West. Cheerio, boys!’ and
Tosher stepped out into the night.</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s the greatest artist Canada has
produced,’ said Ginger.</p>

<p>‘That’s the true Imperialism,’ shouted
Nobby, ‘but you don’t understand it. All
the drivel you got in the Union won’t wash
in practical politics. Tosher can make rings
round you, and’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Look here, boys,’ I said; ‘let’s choke
Nobby and Ginger off. The question before
the House is sport. We’ve got to run the
other company to-morrow, and it’s up to us to
see Beefy through. It’s a matter of <i>esprit de
corps</i>, and we can’t allow the other crowd to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
beat us. Sport is the backbone of the army.
A good sportsman is usually a gentleman. All
the Rugger men are either dead, wounded,
fighting, or training for commissions. If they
can’t sell night-shirts or soap, they <i>can</i> obey
orders, and there’s no doubt they played the
game in August 1914. Never mind about
“after the war.” We can leave that to
Nobby’s crowd. They’ll be running the show.
We shall be much happier ranching or hoofing
it with the Lost Legion. It will be a much
better thing to beat the other company to-morrow
than to sit here reading all the Socialistic
tripe of H. G. Wells or the maudlin
political tosh of Morley. D&mdash;&mdash; it all, there’s
a war on! If Ginger and Nobby won’t turn
up to-morrow, then they are rotters, and we
should out them.’</p>

<p>‘Duck them,’ muttered Beefy.</p>

<p>‘How the&mdash;&mdash; do you know we sha’n’t
be there to-morrow?’ roared Ginger, getting
roused.</p>

<p>‘You’ve vetoed the run, haven’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Have I? Wait and see.’</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It was a cold, crisp day, with a keen, but
healthy, breeze. The ground was not too hard,
and excellent for the show. We were delighted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for there’s nothing like a glorious scramble
across God’s green acres. It cleans the lungs,
refreshes the brain, and gives one a zest for
the things that matter. I am no marvel at
the business, yet in pitting one’s strength
against a fellow-man in friendly rivalry, one
does acquire the sporting instinct, which is a
fair instinct. And to an officer it <i>does</i> give a
sense of values, a ready appreciation of all
that is good in human nature.</p>

<p>Our company officer, Captain Bloggs, was
delighted with the weather prospect. He was
an old Blue, and he <i>did</i> want his ‘boys’ to
knock spots off the other company. And,
strange to say, when we all turned out in
running attire, we found Ginger, Nobby, and
Tosher already there. There was a suspicion of
malicious fun in Ginger’s eyes. I scented something,
and said, ‘Look here, Beefy; there’s some
move on. These fellows are grinning like cats.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, d&mdash;&mdash; them! they won’t be in my
way. They’re soft, and out of training’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bang! went the pistol just then. We went
off. Two hundred men in running-kit make a
pretty show. Our school, I may rightly say,
were the cream of manhood, chosen spartans,
and a sight for the gods. This was no preparatory
school scramble. These fellows were
all in splendid condition, and it was a treat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
slog along and watch them. How easily they
ambled, limbs and will working in perfect harmony!
Hurdles and dikes were taken with
an easy bound; no puffing, no exertion, no
ungainly slithering on the other side. Just a
leap and over. I am quite sure that two
hundred Hun cadets could not have done so
well. Then we reached the open, the crowd
spread out, and the stragglers were more easily
marked. These were the elderly men, but
right merrily they did their best. <i>They wanted
to win.</i> Wasn’t that a perfect spirit? And
isn’t it the basis of our true nature? We may
love to be top-dog, but we <i>do</i> prefer to get it
off our own bat. If we have been very foolish
in worshipping cups, caps, and blazers before
the war, still it helped us at Mons, and certainly
at Ypres. As I watched these fine
fellows sprint by my side something welled
into my heart; it was the pride of school, the
pride of race, the mysterious something which
makes us give our all to keep the old flag
flying. I may be no Christian, but I do love
my fellow-men and my country.</p>

<p>‘Hello! the game’s opening,’ I muttered
on looking ahead. I was a bit behind, for I
had been dreaming. Away in the front was
Beefy. He was heavy, but a splendid athlete.
His staying-power was good, and he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
nerves. With all his faults, Beefy was a
sportsman, and if there was one man consumed
with the craving for victory, it was he. I saw
a long figure slogging steadily by his side. The
style caught my fancy, so I pushed on, and
found it was Ginger. Close behind was Billy
Greens, the parson, and gently dodging by him
was Nobby. Where was Tosher? I looked
behind. He was dogging me. I smiled, but
inwardly. I was just a bit cut. These men
were out for ‘blood.’</p>

<p>I spurted out of my stride, hell for leather,
took a good-sized dike, then pushed hard
across a wide meadow. It was good going,
and my nerves were all out. This was unwise,
but I didn’t want Tosher to head me off. On
reaching a wood I looked back. He was just
behind. With a curse I dashed on, but my
foot went plump into a rabbit-hole, and I was
violently thrown, wrenching my ankle.</p>

<p>‘Are you hurt, old boy?’ asked Tosher.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I grunted.</p>

<p>‘Looks bad. Wait and I’ll get you a
bandage.’</p>

<p>He ran to a stream, tore the two arms off
his running-shirt, soaked them, came back,
and bandaged the now swollen foot.</p>

<p>‘You had better go on now, Tosher. I’ll
hobble home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘No, child. I reckon I’ll carry you.’</p>

<p>‘Get off, man. I’ll manage somehow.’</p>

<p>However, it was useless. I was hoisted on
his back and carried through the ranks of the
grinning stragglers, who shouted, ‘Did ums
do it&mdash;John Brown?’</p>

<p>I did feel an ass.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Beefy, however, was keeping the flag flying.
He saw Ginger, but paid no attention to him.
His eye was on Corporal Jason, the leading
man of the other company, and a magnificent
harrier. This fellow had to be beaten at all
costs. He was not ‘all out’&mdash;his pace was too
steady; so Beefy plugged a couple of yards
behind him. For four miles this went on, and
all the while Ginger ambled as easily as a
deer. He was one of those who are natural
athletes, and who do not need to train.
Nature endows them with amazing reserve-power.
All the time Ginger was studying the
bulldog tenacity of Beefy&mdash;the steady plod,
the quick eye and brain following Corporal
Jason’s every move. It was like dog tracking
dog; and yet it wasn’t. Above the cunning
byplay was the soul of <i>esprit de corps</i>. Both
were out to win. <i>And both meant to.</i></p>

<p>They reached a wide stretch of pasture-land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Jason stretched himself and pushed
on. Beefy followed, a little blown, yet able
to hold. The supreme test was near. Ginger
saw Beefy clench his jaws, raise his head, and
point out the toes to get the fullest stride on
the green-sward. Jason was undoubtedly the
better man, but there was that <i>something</i>
which kept his rival fighting on.</p>

<p><i>Ginger commenced to admire Beefy.</i></p>

<p>At last they reached the open track near
the camp. Ahead was the winning-post.
There an excited crowd had gathered, including
Captain Bloggs, who was fearfully anxious
as he watched the struggle between Jason and
Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Go on, Jason!’</p>

<p>‘Stick it, Beefy!’</p>

<p>These cries rent the air, and for a second
threw Beefy off guard. Jason made a terrific
spurt. With an almost superhuman effort
Beefy recovered and levelled up. Close
behind was that amazing devil, Ginger,
<i>ambling easily</i>. Somehow, no one counted
Ginger as being in the piece. He simply
looked like a runner-up&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>‘Hell for leather, Jason!’</p>

<p>‘Come on, Beefy!’</p>

<p>These were the last cries. Jason made
another magnificent leap; the prize seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
his, but his foot slipped on the wet soil, and
Beefy shot past.</p>

<p>‘You’re winning, Beefy! Go hard!’</p>

<p>It looked like that. <i>Then</i>, just ten yards
from the tape, all were dumbfounded to see
Ginger leap forward like a deer and breast the
line three yards ahead of Beefy Jones.</p>

<p>A terrific cheering burst from the spectators,
but my heart was sick for poor old
Beefy. However, as he burst through the
tape he collided with Ginger, and shouted,
‘Good, Ginger&mdash;we’ve won&mdash;and I’m happy!’</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;the Oxford finish.’</p>

<p>‘All right, old cock; come and have a Cambridge
bath.’</p>

<p>Ginger used up a whole cake of Sunlight
soap.</p>

lot about you since the rainy weather started.
I hope your boots are not letting in, and that
you have not got a cold. I wired Harrods
to-day to send you a Chest-Warmer, felt soles,
and a box of Gregory Powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>I am glad to hear that you have got a
clergyman in your hut, and that you go with
him so often to Communion. And I am sure
you will not waste your leisure hours with
those brainless girls who are always luring
young men into wicked paths.</p>

<p>The rector called to-day, and I asked him
what books I should send you. He suggested
<i>Good Words</i>, <i>Life of David Livingstone</i>, and
the <i>Parish Magazine</i>. I have sent them off.</p>

<p>I was quite shocked to hear you had a
Radical in your hut. I didn’t know Radicals
got commissions. There must be corruption
somewhere, and I am going to write to <i>The
Times</i>.</p>

<p>When do you expect to get a Brigade?</p>

<p>I think that is all just now. Oh, I forgot.
Take a spoonful of the Gregory’s every morning
before breakfast. Your dear father did
that for twenty years.</p>

that is unreasonable. Now, I am not so jealous

her sister Hilda have told me of the interesting
afternoon you all had together in the

were in such good company. But, a week
later, I was so sorry to learn that you and
Beefy had been silly again, sporting about

You are such a puzzle. Yet I can’t help

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">MAKING UP WITH ADELA.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">Adela’s</span> last letter certainly made me
feel a silly ass. Somehow, it upset my
usual happy trend of thought. I couldn’t work,
and my soul was torn with conflicting emotions.
One moment I hated her; the next I loved her.
Then the Devil would whisper in my ear,
‘What has she got to do with it, John Brown?
Sow your wild oats. Have your fun. Everybody’s
doin’ it.’</p>

<p>Privately speaking, Adela was right; but
this righteousness annoyed me. She wasn’t
my sister or my mater, and yet she was giving
me fits for having a bit of fun. Still, Adela
was sweet. She had a way with her. The
attraction was both physical and spiritual. She
had that sort of healthy figure which makes
a student of eugenics stop in the street and
mutter, ‘Here’s the model girl!’ Adela was
also a ripping hockey-player, and one of the
best at tennis. When men saw her knocking
about with a racquet she seemed irresistible.
They wanted to know her&mdash;wanted to kiss her.
And she liked a bit of fun; but she wasn’t a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fool. A girl who can live in a country parish
without getting a sticky label on her name
must be rather decent.</p>

<p>Somehow, she balanced my emotions. After
indulging in sloppy things for a time, she
would say, ‘Come on, John; don’t be decadent.
Let’s talk.’ Then we separated our chairs,
smoked cigarettes, and chatted away about
Kipling, Galsworthy, Hardy, Byron, and
Shelley.</p>

<p>Adela could talk. In the country she had
found time to think. Her observations were
so very shrewd and sane that I often said to
myself, ‘This girl would make a topping wife
and mother.’ I pictured her with rosy-cheeked
kiddies playing in a garden. You needn’t say
that was silly. The best people do it.</p>

<p>And yet she had dropped me (<i>pro tem.</i>) for
these Australians!</p>

<p>However, affection will out. I wanted to
see Adela again; and Beefy wanted to see her
sister. You see, Beefy was a little bored
kissing barmaids, and longed for something
more congenial. As a matter of fact, Beefy
was commencing to <i>think</i>. This was a
revolution.</p>

<p>‘Come on, John. Jump on. We’ll go and
see somebody decent to-day,’ he said.</p>

<p>Away we went, and in twenty minutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Adela and I were alone in the lovely conservatory
overlooking a beautiful country-side.
And didn’t Adela look well! She had such a
nice short skirt which showed her dainty ankles.
But it was in her face and eyes I found rest
and consolation.</p>

<p>Adela was clean.</p>

<p>‘Have a smoke, John. They’re State
Express,’ she said, pushing the box over.
‘And here’s a cup of white coffee.’ This
tempting beverage was served in a charming
cup. As she passed it I touched her hand&mdash;accidentally,
of course. I was thrilled. ‘Now,
Johnnie,’ she said very quietly, ‘let’s have
this thing out. I hate being bad friends, and
I don’t like to hear my pals being discussed
by cooks and kitchen-maids.’</p>

<p>‘You’re jealous,’ I said maliciously.</p>

<p>‘I’m jealous for your uniform, not for you.
My brother has the D.S.O., and he wouldn’t
make an ass of himself&mdash;at least, not in a
local hotel. You haven’t learnt wisdom, old
boy.’</p>

<p>‘Well, you’re to blame. Why did you
toddle off with those Australians?’</p>

<p>‘What a babe you are! You and Beefy
must have a weak kink. Can’t we see other
people? And don’t you think you’re just a
little presumptuous?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Perhaps. But I didn’t break any commandments,
I can assure you.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t need to break a commandment to
be a fool. People don’t judge by the great
things. They sum you up from little things.
When they find cadets hobnobbing with barmaids
and fooling around with chorus-girls,
they think and talk a lot.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, be a sport, for Heaven’s sake! One
would think you were at a Dorcas Society,’ I
said, getting rattled.</p>

<p>‘Very well, Johnnie, if you’re going to be
rude, and not man enough to face things
out, you can go. Men may be scarce, but
girls, at least, have a sense of decency and
pride.’</p>

<p>‘Awfully sorry, old girl. Really, I didn’t
mean to be nasty. But, you know, you are
making a song about it. I’m really sorry, or
I shouldn’t be here. I’ve been dying to come
all the time. I vowed I would never see you
again. But here I am. It’s all you!’</p>

<p>She smiled. She was a woman, after all.
(Between you and me, Adela was a bit soft on
your humble.)</p>

<p>‘You’ll never do it again, will you?’</p>

<p>‘Never&mdash;honest Injun!’</p>

<p>‘Very well, you’re pardoned. And here’s
a kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘You’re a sport, Adela. But what about
those other fellows?’</p>

<p>‘The Australians?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘They’re very nice people. When they want
to come here, they can do so. It isn’t for you
to decide. Cheeky boy!’</p>

<p>‘Then you can’t be my special charmer.’</p>

<p>‘Who wants to be? Do you imagine we
girls are going to allow you to label us
“Special” or “One of the Crowd”? Johnnie,
you’re the limit!’</p>

<p>‘That’s my ultimatum!’</p>

<p>‘You’re a silly kid. If you met those two
Australians, you would be charmed. We
have got to give hospitality to our relatives.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, then, they’re related?’</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;very old friends of the family.’</p>

<p>‘That makes a difference, Adela.’</p>

<p>‘Still, they’re interesting, although they’re
relatives. I’m just longing to see them again.
You may come, too, and guard me, if you like.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t!’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’</p>

<p>‘Do you think, Adela, I’m going to play
second fiddle to your bush-whacking cousins?
Not at all! There’s always the barmaid
for me.’</p>

<p>‘Really, I despair of you. You’re as narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
as can be. But I’m going to be loyal to my
friends.’</p>

<p>‘All right, Adela; I’m off,’ I said, getting
up in a theatrical way. I didn’t really mean
to go. I wanted to test her. But I was so
amazed at her cool acceptance of my dramatic
exit that I repeated, ‘Adela, I’m off,’ and
went to the door.</p>

<p>She followed me out, quietly helped me on
with my coat, and, just as I lifted my hat, she
burst out laughing.</p>

<p>‘What are you laughing at?’</p>

<p>‘You, you silly boy.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’</p>

<p>‘If I showed you the photo of the
Australians, the joke would be apparent.’</p>

<p>‘Well, show it to me,’ I said, glad of finding
any excuse to stay.</p>

<p>‘Very well. Off with your coat!’</p>

<p>I took it off.</p>

<p>‘Now, come in here;’ and she led the way
to the drawing-room. We stepped across to
the mantelpiece, and she lifted a photo.
‘There’s the two Australians,’ she said, with
a grin.</p>

<p>I looked at the photo of two beautiful
Australian girls in nursing-uniform, and
muttered, ‘By Jove, what charming girls!’</p>

<p>‘Are you satisfied now, old King Jealousy?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes; but why didn’t you tell me when you
wrote the letter?’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘For a very womanly reason.’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ I ejaculated, a little annoyed.</p>

<p>‘These girls are so handsome, I couldn’t
afford to take risks. Don’t you know that old
music-hall song?’</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘“Never Introduce your Donah to a Pal.”’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s it, is it? You were afraid of
them collaring Beefy and me.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, old boy; I’m like you&mdash;jealous.’</p>

<p>‘You needn’t have worried, Adela. I really
like you.’</p>

<p>‘Do you, Johnnie?’ she eagerly exclaimed.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I answered.</p>

<p>As her head got mixed up with my khaki
sleeves, I heard her murmuring, ‘Don’t be a
silly ass again&mdash;John Brown.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NOISE OF WAR.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">The</span> best way to understand war is to grasp
the thoughts and the feelings of the
soldier in action. Our newspaper correspondents
have attempted to interpret the soldier’s
feelings for us, but have failed, mainly because
they are not soldiers, and their stuff is written
in comparative comfort. It is fashionable to
‘write up’ the soldier advancing to the cannon’s
mouth as if he were going to Brighton
for a week-end. This is ridiculous, for this
reason, that the soldier is just human, and
when facing death he experiences all the symptoms
of an invalid who is about to undergo
a serious operation. But to make the whole
thing clear to you, let me reproduce a little
discussion we had in our hut one night.</p>

<p>It was Beefy who broached the subject by a
casual remark to the effect that when he went
over the top at Loos he felt as if he wanted to
go home&mdash;quick.</p>

<p>‘That’s just how I felt,’ said Billy Greens.</p>

<p>We gathered round the last speaker and asked
him to go on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, well, let me be frank, and say I was
never in such a funk in all my life. I am sure
many more felt the same; but, of course, we
never said so. What heartened me to go on
was the remark our colonel made as he went
over the top. He said, “Look here, men;
the Boche is just as frightened as we are, so
come on.” This idea gave me comfort. Still,
my knees were groggy, and I believe if I had
met a Hun then it would have been a bad
show for me.’</p>

<p>‘What made you go forward?’ I asked him.</p>

<p>‘Discipline, and the knowledge that if I
funked, my name would stick in the mud for
ever. I am not a hero, and I believe thousands
feel like that. We are really a race of
pacifists; but, for all that, I hold that a pacifist
nation in arms is much more deadly than
a nation nurtured on the themes of Bernhardi.
None of us is in this business because he likes
it. Personally, I loathe the whole scheme.
It is ghastly. Still we, apparently, can only
end it by fighting, and that is why I and many
others are in.’</p>

<p>‘What frightened you most, Billy?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, the noise&mdash;the terrible noise. If it
weren’t for the high explosives I believe war
wouldn’t be half bad. But it is the noise
which has a demoralising effect on the educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
brain. It stuns, unnerves, and creates
a thousand fears. Mind you, I don’t think it
has the same effect on a navvy, a miner, or
any sort of manual labourer. These men have
no nerves, and for that reason I think they are
the best private soldiers. The duller the
brain, the less the suffering. But modern war
is a terrible thing for the highly sensitive and
highly skilled.’</p>

<p>‘Did you reach your objective all right?’
asked Ginger.</p>

<p>‘Yes. I saw the C.O. ahead, waving us on,
and I went. The man seemed so brave that
one really couldn’t let him down, so we just
followed. But I was still nervous. Then I
saw the C.O. fall. He was shot through the
stomach. I went mad. I wanted to kill some
one. When I got to the first line of the
Huns I saw a big fellow skulking away. I
shot him&mdash;<i>dead</i>. After that I wanted more.
God forgive me for the feeling, but I’m sure it
was the primitive lust to kill. It’s in us all.
Education seemed but a veneer. When it was
all over I went into a corner and prayed.
Ugh! it’s a horrible business,’ concluded
Billy.</p>

<p>‘Yes, we all have much the same experience,’
added Nobby Clarke. ‘Personally,
it wasn’t the thought of death that worried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
me, but the secret fear of getting a stomach-wound,
and being left out in No Man’s Land.
And I believe almost every officer and man
has the same secret dread. The reason, I
think, is that an abdominal wound is usually
fatal or crippling, and a man does not like to
picture a bayonet or a lump of shrapnel in his
tummy. If a scientist could devise a light
bullet-proof abdominal belt, I believe that men
would go forward much quicker and more
confidently.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think the Hun has the same fear?’
I asked.</p>

<p>‘I think the Hun is even more afraid of a
stomach-wound than we are. Man to man, he
is not our equal in bayonet-fighting. It may
be lack of training, but I imagine it really is
due to the fact that he is flabby and no sportsman.
For example, in the one bayonet-fight
which I was in, <i>not one</i> of the Huns stood
up to us. They flung their rifles away and
squealed like pigs. Cold steel to a German is
worse than gas or shells. The Hun is terror-stricken
when he sees the knife of the
Gurkha.’</p>

<p>‘Who do you think are really best with the
bayonet, Nobby?’ asked Billy.</p>

<p>‘I imagine the Russians are really top-dog.
You see, they are primitive, and educated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the knife. Like all semi-civilised peoples, the
Russians can stand the most awful punishment.
The Bulgarians are also good. Still,
it is a fact that the Irish can beat them. In
that little scrap between some Irishmen and
Bulgarians during the retirement in Macedonia,
the Irishmen won. The Irish, like the
Scots, are fiery, almost mad, in action. Once
they are roused, nothing will stop them.’</p>

<p>‘What was your experience, Ginger?’ I
asked, switching the discussion back to its
original point.</p>

<p>‘The five minutes before going over were
worse than the whole day’s fighting. We had
too much time to think, and my imagination
was running riot. I didn’t feel like a soldier.
I felt like a lamb going to the slaughter.
What really impressed me was how men could
live in such a barrage. Worse, the thousands
of bullets which were whistling, cracking, and
splashing over and against the parapet seemed
to whisper death was near. Of course, I had
forgotten that it takes about a thousand rounds
to secure one dead man. However, it is wonderful
what example and training <i>will</i> do. I
believe that, no matter how funky a man may
feel, if he has been to a good school he immediately
thinks, “What will they say in school if
I make a bad show?” Training is also useful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Months of discipline tell. But the greatest
asset is the bearing of the officer and the
N.C.O. Fortunately, we had a splendid company
commander. He could mask his feelings.
While I believe the man was suffering just as
we were suffering, he walked down the line
smiling, cheering, and inspiring. When the
time came to go, he was first over, and we
followed like deer.</p>

<p>‘Once we were over, I seemed to be too
excited to suffer from nervous troubles. The
noise, the shouting, the running, and the sight
of the Huns bolting, somehow, carried us along.
The plight of the enemy also raised the sporting
instinct, and we followed as if out shooting
hares. Again, I did feel a <i>true</i> hate of the
Hun. Belgium and Serbia seemed to flash
through my brain, with the result that I was
out for results. One Hun fired at me point-blank,
but missed. I shoved my bayonet into
him. To me it was the most awful physical
sensation. I felt sick, but I withdrew automatically,
as if I had been at bayonet-drill.
There was no more time to moralise, for I
was fighting for my life. It isn’t a healthy
business. I believe we, as a nation, abhor it;
none the less I feel, without bragging, that,
once at close quarters, we can always beat
the Hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Ginger; and the war has proved that
we are not the decadent nation many thought
we were,’ I remarked.</p>

<p>‘By no means, John. Trafalgar, Waterloo,
Inkermann, and Tel-el-kebir are mere skirmishes
compared to Ypres, Loos, and Cambrai.
Nelson’s or Wellington’s men never endured
the sufferings of the men to-day. It is really
wonderful how this city-bred, over-civilised
nation has stuck it out. But another war of
this kind would send the world insane. It’s
the noise&mdash;the <i>awful</i> noise&mdash;that is playing
the devil with the nerves of all.’</p>

<p>What Ginger said about the noise was true.
Noise is the worst feature of war, and in military
hospitals you find patients reverting again
and again to this theme. And seldom do our
men profess a liking for war. The experiences
of Billy, Nobby, and Ginger are characteristic
of thousands. They carry on out of a sense of
duty, a love of country, and an innate conviction
that the only way to end this horrible
scourge is to punish its authors and apostles.
The world will never be clean and joyful until
we absolutely crush the horrible mentality of
the ruling German. The sword is not a good
investment. He who lives by it, perishes by
it. And it does seem awful that this bloodshed,
misery, madness, and sorrow should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
been thrust on a happy world by men whose
real aim is power, wealth, loot, and lust. This
war ought to end war. Ordeal by battle may
suit our pagan philosophers. But there is no
doubt that once we have settled this matter
with Germany, the nations of the earth will
refuse to resort to arms again. To ensure this
honourable aim, Germany ought to compel her
kings, princes, ambassadors, and statesmen to
serve as privates in the present war.</p>

<p>The noise&mdash;<i>the terrible noise</i>&mdash;would convince
them of the madness of it all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">BLASE-BONES FROM SANDWURSE.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">Sandwurse</span> is a very wonderful place.
It has produced some exalted men, but,
like all institutions, it occasionally throws out
a prig. This doesn’t happen very often, but
when it occurs the specimen is a real one.
And it was the bad fortune of our hitherto
happy platoon to be saddled with one of the
species. Our dear old platoon officer, Lieutenant
Blessem, was found fit for duty, and
departed, amid the tears of our hut. We
loved that man. He was so kind, so considerate,
so interested; and he wasn’t a sneak.
Even Ginger admired him, and that was a
compliment from our platoon high-brow.
Lieutenant Blase-Bones then blew in.</p>

<p>We saw him approach the hut from our
window. What a gorgeous Nut&mdash;all brilliantine,
brown polish, and brasso!</p>

<p>‘Some lad!’ muttered Ginger, scenting
trouble.</p>

<p>‘He looks as if he couldn’t help it,’ I
remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Looks a ruddy ass,’ mumbled Beefy.</p>

<p>Then the door banged, and the sergeant-major
shouted, ‘Stand to your beds!’</p>

<p>We sprang to attention, and Blase-Bones
entered as if he were the conqueror of Bagdad,
Berlin, and Timbuctoo. He had a monocle&mdash;of
course.</p>

<p>‘This hut looks like a beah-garden. Open
that windah theah,’ he said, looking at me.</p>

<p>I obeyed. Twelve months in the ranks had
taught me a lot.</p>

<p>‘Whose bed is this?’ he said, on arriving at
Ginger’s doss-house.</p>

<p>I must own it looked the bally limit. But
even the old commandant had never checked
it. The C.O.’s view was that we were there
to train and be educated, <i>not</i> wearied with
pipeclay and eye-wash.</p>

<p>‘It’s mine, sir,’ answered Ginger.</p>

<p>‘Clean it up. Look smart!’</p>

<p>With a groan, Ginger leisurely commenced
to bundle H. G. Wells, Conrad, Haking,
Browning, and Zola into a long-suffering box.</p>

<p>‘Are these your boots?’ he asked Tosher.</p>

<p>‘Guess they are,’ said the Canadian casually.</p>

<p>‘“Sir,” when you speak to an officer.’</p>

<p>Tosher grinned. Fortunately this levity
went unnoticed. And then Blase-Bones
arrived at Billy Greens’s doss. Billy, as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
know, was a parson, highly strung, very
nervous, and afraid of all military mandarins.
We, who knew him, loved him; for Billy was
the biggest-hearted man ever made. We
shielded him from a good deal of trouble, and
we were shocked when the new platoon officer,
realising Billy’s nervousness, pounced on him.
Here was a chance to show off and impress the
hut that the new platoon commander was a
mighty smart fellow!</p>

<p>‘Is this your bed?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Y-e-s, sir,’ said Billy, his hands twitching.</p>

<p>‘Most untidy! What an example! How
can you expect to be an officer?’</p>

<p>‘I’ve never been checked be-fore, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Hold your tongue! Tidy it up.&mdash;And, I
say, sergeant-major.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Inspect this hut in an hour’s time, and
report to me.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir.’</p>

<p>Off he went, swinging his cane in a brainless
manner, and leaving behind him a well of hate
and scorn. This man had in ten minutes
smashed our happy home, and given us a
prospect of h&mdash;&mdash; for the next two months.</p>

<p>‘Old Army!’ said Ginger ironically, as the
door banged.</p>

<p>‘No, Ginger; he’s the fag-end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
system, but he isn’t a patch on the other
good fellows,’ I answered.</p>

<p>‘He’s a prize prig, anyway. He’s out for
trouble; but I fancy we can do him in.’</p>

<p>‘Sure thing,’ grunted Tosher.</p>

<p>‘He’s only a boy&mdash;a foolish boy,’ commented
Billy, who was indeed a most tolerant man.</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what he is,’ remarked Beefy.
‘He’s a ruddy inefficient swine, chucked out
of some crack battalion.’</p>

<p>And that was about right!</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Next day Blase-Bones had us all up for a
lecture.</p>

<p>‘You know, you fellows need a lot of bucking
up. Of course, I can see that, being New Army
men, you’re a bit handicapped. And I think
it’s an awful pity, don’t you know, that you
couldn’t have gone to Sandwurse. However,
it’s my good fortune to be in command.’ (How
he loved that word!) ‘If you will pay attention
to me, I hope to pull you through.’</p>

<p>‘God help us!’ mumbled Ginger, who was
at the back.</p>

<p>‘What’s that?’ he inquired.</p>

<p>‘I was just saying, sir, how much you’d
help us.’</p>

<p>‘I see&mdash;I see,’ he muttered, but quite convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that Ginger was pulling his leg. However,
he had a face of brass, and continued: ‘I
want your huts smartened up. They ought to
be like a ship’s deck, with everything in order.
And there’s too much “fug,” too many d&mdash;&mdash;
novels lying around. I saw one yesterday by
that beastly fellow, H. G. Wells. If you feel
you want to read, get Kipling and the <i>Morning
Post</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Do you permit the <i>Daily News</i>, sir?’
inquired Nobby, in such a humble (but
assumed) manner that Blase-Bones thought
Nobby was actually appealing to his profound
knowledge.</p>

<p>‘Certainly not! But I should be awfully
pleased to write you a list of papers and books,
if you care to have it. I’m sure they would
help you to understand the war. Another
thing! I addressed one man yesterday, and he
did not say “sir” when replying. This must
not occur again. It’s rotten bad form, and I
won’t have it! Won’t have it! Dismiss!’</p>

<p>Ginger rose with a groan. All his Oxford
Imperialism had vanished. He wanted to be
a murderer and a revolutionary. We took
him to the canteen and gave him a drink.
He recovered!</p>

<p>‘Say, boys, I reckon we’ve got to get busy,’
said Tosher that evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Your proposition?’ demanded Ginger.</p>

<p>‘Anything from slicing to lynching. I
guess the world ain’t any the richer for that
production.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll catch him, duck him, and d&mdash;&mdash; the
consequences.’</p>

<p>‘Tar and feather him,’ suggested Beefy.</p>

<p>‘I think you are all very stupid,’ remarked
Billy. ‘Why should you worry yourself about
an atom? He can’t go too far. The company
officer will see to that. Give him a full rope
and he’ll hang himself.’ Billy Greens was
afraid of revolt.</p>

<p>‘Well, boys, I’m a lawyer,’ submitted Nobby.
‘This man may be an ass; but he’s got the
Manual of Military Law behind him, and don’t
forget it. We’re in the army, “don’t you
know,” and this youth would come out top-dog.
Again, I’m too jolly lazy to entertain
the thought of getting chucked for my commission,
and sent back to do orderly-man.
Therefore, I say, give him rope, and, as the
padre says, he’ll hang himself.’</p>

<p>‘Meantime we suffer,’ commented Ginger.</p>

<p>‘That suffering, old chap, is not as bad as
fighting the Boche.’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Let’s vote for Nobby’s idea,’ I said. ‘We
don’t want to make bally fools of ourselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Besides, there’s the reputation of the school,
<i>and</i> the old commandant. I don’t think
we ought to let the Old Man down. He’s
been good to us.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right, John! That’s right!’ exclaimed
the padre, glad to think a budding
mutiny was being quelled.</p>

<p>‘Oh, very well. We’ll study the brute,’
concluded Ginger, recalling the lecture on
psychology.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>For the next fortnight we had a dog’s life.
The company commander, who was a real good
chap, didn’t notice it. He was such a perfect
sport and gentleman that he concluded his new
officer was the same. Billy and I, however,
threw our influence into the scales of neutrality,
for Tosher and Ginger, when roused, were of
violent temper. They were such good pals
that we were not a little afraid of their rapidly
fraying temper.</p>

<p>At last the storm-clouds burst.</p>

<p>At morning parade Blase-Bones was inspecting
the platoon. He was in a bad mood.
When he reached Ginger he remarked, ‘What
do you mean by coming out with such shocking
boots?’</p>

<p>‘It was wet yesterday, sir. I’ve tried to
polish them. I’ve done my best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Your best is not <i>my</i> best. Understand?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir.’</p>

<p>‘You’re insolent.’</p>

<p>‘No, sir. I’m endeavouring to understand
you.’</p>

<p>‘I know your type. Enough!’</p>

<p>‘I shall feel much obliged, sir, if you will
cease to be personal.’</p>

<p>‘Take his name, sergeant-major.’</p>

<p>Ginger was mad.</p>

<p>‘There’s dust on your belt. Why?’ Blase-Bones
now asked Tosher.</p>

<p>‘I’m real sorry,’ answered the Canadian.</p>

<p>‘“Sir,” when you answer me.’</p>

<p>‘You ain’t wise, boy.’</p>

<p>‘Silence!&mdash;Take his name.’</p>

<p>Tosher’s hands quivered; then he stood still,
his face pale with suppressed anger.</p>

<p>I went through that morning’s drill sick as
a dog. And the only solution I could discover
was that Blase-Bones was either ignorant or
mad. But that didn’t alter the plight of Ginger
or Tosher. I trembled to think what might
happen. As they were cadets, a high code of
discipline was expected of them, and this had
been observed under our former platoon commander.
Indeed, our platoon had the highest
marks in sports and examinations. Yet this
awful prig had smashed it all up. If I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
sorry for Ginger and Tosher, I was more sorry
for the commandant. This affair would break
the Old Man’s heart. However, I did not
know that the colonel had already weighed
Blase-Bones up. He was a shrewd judge of
character, a man of stern moods, but a just
C.O. and a gentleman.</p>

<p>Finally, he <i>understood</i> Canadians.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Ginger and Tosher, with an escort, of which
I formed part, were before the colonel. The
Old Man, I could see, was pained and sad.
This was the first real ‘dust-up’ in the school.
Blase-Bones gave his evidence. Then the
colonel sorrowfully raised his head, and quietly
asked, ‘Well, men, what have you got to
say?’</p>

<p>‘I regret, sir, committing a breach of discipline,’
said Ginger, ‘but my old officers in
my own regiment never addressed me in such
a manner. Lieutenant Blase-Bones apparently
has a contempt for the New Army. I belong
to the First Hundred Thousand, and I decline
to be treated in this way. The commission is
nothing to me, sir, and I desire to be returned
to my battalion. This officer has not heard a
shot fired in the war.’</p>

<p>Blase-Bones turned ghastly white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Is that all you have to say?’ inquired the
‘com.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘And your defence?’ he asked Tosher.</p>

<p>‘I’m just real sorry, colonel, to waste your
time. But since this foolish boy blew into our
shack, there’s been nothing but gaw-damns
and muttered revolution. Why, sir, we were
the happiest bunch of kids in the British
Army when Old Bobby Blessem was boss of
the show.’</p>

<p>‘You mean Lieutenant Blessem, I presume,’
said the colonel, correcting him.</p>

<p>‘I guess you’re right, colonel; but you know
in the Western world we talk free and mean
no offence.’</p>

<p>‘I quite understand,’ answered the C.O.
tactfully. ‘Go on.’ There was a twinkle in
the corner of the C.O.’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘I’m a Canadian, sir. I’m here to give the
Old Land a lift against these blasted Huns.
But I ain’t here to be knocked around by
flannel-headed hobos.’</p>

<p>‘Just a minute, Johnson,’ said the colonel.
‘I am asking for your defence, and as a future
officer you must realise that expressions of
opinion have no bearing on the case. You are
charged with dirty equipment and insolence.
Please keep to the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Sure, sir! My belt was clean as it was for
the Prince o’ Wales’s inspection in France.
What’s good enough for the son of a king is
good enough for any two-pipped child in this
institooshun. As for insolence, I reckon we
Canadians ain’t out to grovel at the feet of
snobs, though we don’t mind givin’ a “sir” now
and again to a white man like yourself.’</p>

<p>‘But don’t you see that a young officer,
unacquainted with the Canadian temperament,
might misinterpret your attitude?’</p>

<p>‘Maybe, colonel; but it’s up to you to
educate this child. I’m no chicken in the
fighting business. Out West I make ten thousand
dollars a year. Seems to me that your
old machinery’s all wrong. And I guess you
can’t do me in as long as these things are
hanging around my figure,’ concluded Tosher,
throwing the Military Medal and the D.C.M.
on the table.</p>

<p>Blase-Bones was trembling. I felt sorry for
the ass.</p>

<p>There was a strange silence in the room for
a couple of minutes. The colonel was outwardly
studying conduct-sheets, but in reality
he was weighing up in his own mind how he
could maintain justice without letting an officer
down in front of the rank and file. It was
an awkward position. Much depended on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
decision. He knew there was a whole Canadian
Government behind Tosher, and a House of
Commons behind Ginger. He also knew that
if he muddled the issue, the War Office might
promptly lift him out of his job. The commandant,
as one of the old school, was nobly
striving to bring the Manual of Military Law
into line with the blunt (but honest) democracy
of the New Army and the Canadian
Force.</p>

<p>At last he looked up at Ginger and inquired,
‘Will you take my punishment?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’ Ginger had complete confidence
in the C.O.</p>

<p>‘And you?’ he asked Tosher.</p>

<p>‘I guess I will, colonel, if it doesn’t mean
time in a stone-breakin’ institooshun.’</p>

<p>‘Very well! In my opinion there’s been a
great lack of tact on the part of your officer,
just as there has been a great lack of sense on
your part. It is not for you to reply on parade.
If you have a grievance, come to me. I’m
paid to keep everybody in order. I’m going
to punish you for that. If there is no discipline,
there is no army. You, as future officers, must
realise that. Both of you will be confined to
camp for a week. Understand?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ said the colonel, ‘I request your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
platoon commander to apologise to you here
in my presence. You are good soldiers. You
have both been honoured by the King. Your
officer has no right to cast aspersions on the
New Army, and to conduct his work in a
manner calculated to stir hostility. I won’t
have it.&mdash;Please apologise, Mr Blase-Bones.’</p>

<p>‘I’m&mdash;exceedingly sorry. I’m just afraid
I’ve made a&mdash;mistake. I hope you will pardon
me,’ muttered the crestfallen subaltern.</p>

<p>‘Fall out, men,’ said the C.O. kindly.</p>

<p>We were marched out, Ginger and Tosher
quite well pleased with the colonel’s verdict.</p>

<p><i>The C.O. knew his job.</i></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>That night Colonel Eat-All went to his
quarters weary and worn. The affair had made
him most unhappy. He was just afraid of
what the Canadian <i>might</i> do. However, on
opening the door of his hut, he was surprised
to see a beautiful bowl of red roses on the
table. He called his servant and asked where
they came from.</p>

<p>‘Don’t know, sir. When I came back after
tea they were there.’</p>

<p>‘That’s all, thank you.’</p>

<p>The colonel went forward and picked up the
bunch of flowers. There was a tiny label<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
attached. On the label he read: ‘To our Dear
Old Colonel&mdash;from two Defaulters.’</p>

<p>Something fell on the Old Man’s hand. It
was a tear.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">OUR DEAR OLD COMMANDANT.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">If</span> we thought a lot of our school, and did
our best to keep up its good name, this
was due not to a swelling admiration of the
military system, but mainly to a sense of
patriotism. It was also a tribute of respect to
our commandant. He was not a brilliant man,
and in some things was an absolute fire-eater.
However, his bark was worse than his bite,
and he improved on acquaintance. The Old
Man was sincere. He was no sneak. There
was nothing petty in his decisions, and little
things revealed a passionate love of his ‘boys’
rather than a selfish love of his job. In his
day he had been a gallant soldier and ‘a bit of
a lad.’ As a man of the world, he understood
human nature, and his one desire was to have
a happy and successful unit.</p>

<p>He had a hard-working but not a brilliant
staff. Brilliant men are scarce as instructors
in cadet schools. The military system, even
to-day, is not kind to brilliance. It is afraid
of genius. Genius even in this war has too
often been attacked and destroyed. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
other hand, it is just to note that the brilliant
men who have <i>survived</i> the ordeal of jealousy
are all at the front, and therefore beyond the
reach of cadet schools. What a pity! For
in these cadet schools men hunger for more
light and congenial thought. Captain Cheerall,
I may say, was the great exception. It is good
to write such things. The War Office ought
certainly to know them. The reason it <i>doesn’t
know</i> is that those who are running these
schools are afraid to be frank. Push-and-go
is not appreciated by certain soft-jobbers in
the Home Commands; and they have a
quiet but brutal way of dispensing with men
who want to be ‘American’ and revolutionise
our whole system of military education.</p>

<p>It is imagined by military mandarins that
we cadets don’t know and don’t see anything.
What a blunder! At our school, and at every
other cadet school, you can find the cream of
intellect studying for commissions. The nation
is in arms. And many a lecturer ignores the
fact that he is talking to men with the highest
university degrees. These men in our school
never declared they had nothing to learn.
Indeed, they promptly realised their appalling
deficiencies in military education. They
hungered for learning. When they got a little,
they wanted more; and a good lecturer always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
left the room to the accompaniment of resounding
cheers. This attitude of cadets is in
striking contrast with the attitude of those
who regard them as ‘a d&mdash;&mdash; lot of Tommies
who want knocking about.’ We never objected
to being knocked about, even by the
sergeant-major from the Guards. But what
we did resent was the visit of silly old fools,
who talked a lot of rot and gave us no intellectual
food. We were not blind, and all of
us had ‘been out.’ If we were deficient in
higher strategy, we had a share of common-sense.
Had a War Office inspector tumbled
into our midst disguised as a cadet, he would
have heard frank appreciation of all that was
good, and a damning indictment of all that
was bad. The greatest weakness of the military
system is that it declines to be told,
seldom asks for suggestions, and is up against
an intellectual aristocracy. This fear of intellect
has been our curse in this war. And
only one statesman has fought for ‘The New
School.’ That man is David Lloyd George.
But even Lloyd George has found that he
cannot entirely eradicate the fossilised follies
of the old régime.</p>

<p>For all that, we were not unhappy. When
we ceased to analyse the appalling anomalies
of the military system, we enjoyed ourselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Army life does teach fellowship and breed
great friendships. Our hut was tenanted by
a band of brothers. Our company commander
was a ‘sport,’ and the C.O. had rid us of our
platoon commander, who was a prize prig
and an insufferable snob. We got a new
platoon commander, Lieutenant Damall, who
was an intellectual rebel, a first-class soldier,
a fine lecturer, and a jolly good chap. The
general routine of the school was stiff, yet
bearable. But it would have been an absolute
joy if more brains had been knocking around.
However, the sheet-anchor, the personality,
the father, friend, jailer, and general entertainer,
was the dear old commandant. He
would come on parade and play h&mdash;&mdash; with
everybody, turn us upside-down, call us fat-heads
and duffers, then wind up with, ‘You
know, boys, I curse you because I love you.
And I <i>do</i> want to be proud of you. I want to
see you all generals and V. C.’s. Buck up, for
Heaven’s sake, or, by Gad, I’ll have you shot!’
and off he would stump, pretending he was in
a devil of a temper. In reality the Old Man
was playing quite a clever game. He had that
wonderful secret of knowing how to ‘curse’ a
man, and yet make a man smile and do his
best. He was not brilliant&mdash;but he was wise.
And he was jolly good fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You know, gentlemen,’ he said one day at
a lecture, ‘I was a bit of a lad when I was
young. An awful blood! Wouldn’t call a
duke my cousin, and was measured for everything&mdash;even
my ties. Of course, that was in
the good old days when we had nothing but
nigger wars, and we used to spend nearly all
our time hunting foxes or struggling to get in
at stage doors. I was jolly good at that.</p>

<p>‘When I joined my battalion a colour-sergeant
was told off to carry me about. This
fellow had to think for me, even on parade.
He was always at my elbow whispering the
words of command&mdash;for which I can assure
you I often thanked the Lord. For, to be
perfectly frank with you, like many young
officers, I was a bit of an ass. I achieved
fame at a general’s inspection by giving my
company the command “Trail arms!” instead
of “Present!” for which I got six months’
marked drill on the square. They gave me
no leave; wouldn’t even allow me to pop out
and see my best girl (as I allow you to do);
but from 9 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> till 4 <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> an old sergeant
gave me dyspepsia, colic, and lumbago by
marching, counter-marching, and doubling on
that terrible barrack square. I wore out two
pairs of boots, and was almost excommunicated
by the garrison chaplain owing to the awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
language which I used after those parades.
It was a bitter lesson; but it did me good,
although I didn’t think so at the time. I am
just afraid I was a saucy young devil.</p>

<p>‘Of course, in those days a subaltern was
very small fry. He was merely a “fag” in
the regimental system. It was very dangerous
to think&mdash;it still is a bit dangerous to do so&mdash;and
the great secret of success was to eliminate
any trace of personality or originality. As a
sarcastic old major remarked, all he demanded
of a subaltern was to be strong in the back
and soft in the head. In passing, I may say
I was awfully popular with this old chap.
Perhaps I was up to his marvellous standard.
I led him to think so, for I readily found out
that the line of least resistance was the one
which assured a calm and charming life. You
may think that a terrible revelation, but if you
study the British Army in the ‘seventies, you
will see that it would have been disastrous for
any man of mediocre talent to start thrusting
out his hand for the field-marshal’s baton.</p>

<p>‘Company commanders in those days
directed operations from the anterooms or
their bedrooms, and we long-suffering, fat-headed
subs. fetched and carried for them.
They were the drones, and we were the working-bees.
At least, we thought we were, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
what we actually did was this. We received
our orders, then went to the company office
and simply passed them on. The colour-sergeants
were really the foremen of works.
These old N.C.O.’s were marvellous men&mdash;men
of great attainments, and men whose
abilities were not rewarded as they are to-day.
Under the old system the officer was a god,
not to be defiled by mere toil or clear thinking.
Our daily task commenced about 10 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, and
finished about noon. When we had to work
in the afternoon we always talked about
resigning our commissions. We had an extraordinary
view that we were there to enjoy
ourselves and look pretty, and it was most
unfair to burden our brains with 5+5=10.</p>

<p>‘I am telling you these things, not because I
long for those old times again. When I see you
boys doing so many interesting things to-day,
I feel I must teach you to abhor shams, to face
facts, and to tell the truth. In those days I
couldn’t see the hollowness and the rottenness
of it all. I see it now, for I have no illusions.
War is a brutal business. Facts predominate.
If you have the moral courage to get up in
front of your men and admit an error, and
seek for light and co-operation, you will show
evidence of greatness.</p>

<p>‘We were very pretty in those days. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
rejoiced in my figure, which, as with all
fashionable officers, was kept in order by
common or garden corsets. When we went
out in review order we were a sight for the
girls and&mdash;“the mob.” The men were just as
smart. Indeed, a battalion looked like a thousand
dandies out of a cutter’s window. I have
an affection for that aspect of the past. It is
no crime to be a well-dressed man. Even
to-day it is most important that an officer
should look the picture of a clean, alert, and
well-groomed British gentleman. That is an
aid to discipline. Every Tommy is an aristocrat.
As one of my men once remarked, “I
likes my orficer to look a ruddy toff.” Of
course, there was a great weakness in this
system. It was overdone. We concentrated
on brass bands, pipeclay, and eye-wash. The
men were mere automatons; the discipline
was harsh, in some cases brutal; while
strategy and tactics were not worshipped as
we worship them now. This was not our
fault. It was due to the age. The German
menace was not even dreamt of. We had
only frontier skirmishes to deal with. And
we all enlisted&mdash;for fun.</p>

<p>‘As for training, it was not at all intelligent.
We did field-days in full-dress uniforms, busbies,
cross-belts, and all the glitter used on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
review parades. Even in India troops wore
European clothing, and died by the hundred
from heat apoplexy. The frontal attack was
the summit of our knowledge, and “form
square” for savage warfare our one great
stunt. It looked pretty. And it was this
damnable craving for prettiness which hindered
the development of military training.
Of course, I did not know that then. To me
life was one huge jest. But I had a rude
awakening.</p>

<p>‘In a frontier skirmish, my regiment was
attacking a difficult position held by some of
the hill tribes. The C.O., who was a charming
old gentleman, but no soldier, decided on
the usual thing&mdash;a frontal attack. We went
forward. Two companies were almost annihilated.
The senior major, a fairly able man,
who was leading the attack, decided it was
suicide to go farther, and ordered the retirement.
We went back. The colonel demanded an
explanation. The major very respectfully
pointed out the stupidity of the arrangement,
and suggested a feint attack on the front,
combined with an enveloping movement round
both flanks.</p>

<p>‘“Bosh!” replied the Old Man. He ordered
us forward again. Another company was decimated,
and fortunately the colonel was among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the casualties. If he had lived, he would have
killed every man by his stupid tactics. The
major then withdrew the battalion. That
night he made arrangements for another
attack at dawn. One hundred men were sent
to make a feint at the front, and two hundred
more were divided into two columns to attack
the right and left flanks. The remainder were
in reserve. At dawn we carried out his
orders. Two hours afterwards we had captured
the position, three hundred of the
enemy, one gun, and lots of loot.</p>

<p>‘<i>Our casualties in that attack were fifty-five.</i></p>

<p>‘<i>Our previous casualties were about three
hundred and fifty.</i></p>

<p>‘This to me was a revelation of the use of
brains, and an indication that brains can save
human life. From that day, gentlemen, I
honestly tried to be intelligent. But I had
to go warily. I swotted up Napoleon and
Frederick the Great&mdash;<i>in secret</i>; for it was
considered bad form to be a student. Even
then I did not quite appreciate the terrible
dangers of such false “form.” However, I had
the courage to chuck my fashionable regiment
and become a soldier of fortune in the Indian
and Egyptian Armies. From those two great
and immortal men, Kitchener and Roberts,
I acquired any little knowledge I possess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Still, I am not a marvellous soldier&mdash;and know
it. But one thing I have been taught, and
that is&mdash;sincerity.</p>

<p>‘When I make a blunder, I have no hesitation
in cutting my losses. Nor am I afraid of
criticism or suggestion. You may find this
lacking in certain spheres of military life. But
do not despair. Do your duty! Be loyal!
And attempt no far-reaching reforms unless
you have the genius and the courage to carry
them out. Otherwise you will only batter
your head against a brick wall. Progress is
with you, and you are all young. I wish I
were sitting with you as a cadet, and not
talking to you with the rank of a colonel. In
this war my age seems a curse. Your field is
wide and your opportunities are illimitable.
To the keen soldier this <i>is</i> a day of glory!</p>

<p>‘For all that, I do not say our system is
perfect. And I am not going to insist that
the best men are always pushed on. But I
do believe the system is improving. And I
can assure you that I am doing my best to
smash false barriers. I am not popular with
certain people for this. Popularity is nothing
to me. I have boys of my own. While I
think this is a good school, I quite realise it
is not a perfect school. We have not cut the
old shackles yet, but we are getting on. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
are young and impatient. I know your dreams.
I know your hopes. I know how you grouse,
and I often hear some of you say, “Oh, here’s
that frosted old dug-out again.” But I am
quite sure you don’t mean anything&mdash;just as
I am quite convinced you try your best.</p>

<p>‘Frankly, gentlemen, you have much to be
grateful for. You are getting in this school
as much knowledge as the old army officer got
in twenty years. It may not be issued in
palatable or popular form. It may jar your
temperament, but the “stuff” is there, if you
care to pick it up. I cannot talk to you like
Sir Oliver Lodge or fascinate you like Lord
Rosebery. I am a plain soldier. My staff
are plain soldiers, but they are hard workers.
They are doing their best for you, and it is up
to you to do your best for them. If I, your
colonel, have the courage to come and tell you
of my own deficiencies, surely you boys will
have the pluck to do a little heart-searching.
You must also study the Service as a whole,
and not in parts. Believe me, the British
Army is a proud and glorious institution.
The traditions are high. Great men have
come from our ranks. In this war our arms
are belaurelled with chivalry. Ours is no
mercenary host, no band of knaves or babe-assassins.
We fight a good fight. While I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
am no great Christian, I do believe we are
the New Crusaders. This is a Holy Crusade.</p>

<p>‘To sum up my theme, let me say I have
told you of the jolly but inefficient past simply
to show the marvellous advance made in
military education, how we have blundered
through to a more sensible and useful system.
If you feel there are imperfections to-day, you
would have been shocked had you soldiered in
the ‘seventies. For all that, I do not want
you to feel contented&mdash;not even with me. A
healthy discontent is a sign of a progressive
mind. Always look forward. Always endeavour
to develop new ideas and produce fresh
thoughts. But in doing so, try to incorporate
the best from the past. Shatter stupid tradition,
certainly; but remember this, gentlemen&mdash;if
your fathers are old, they are also wise
with experience. And never insult old age or
scorn good counsel.</p>

<p>‘Yours is a high calling. Yours is a noble
cause. You are all my boys, and I want to
be proud of you. When you go from here I
shall watch your careers. If you feel you
have any respect for me and this school&mdash;imperfect
as it is&mdash;then I ask you to honour
the King, play the game, be good citizens and
gallant British officers. That’s all.’</p>

<p>When the Old Man finished an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thing happened. Tosher, the Canadian, jumped
up on the table and shouted, ‘Three cheers
for the good old colonel!’ Our wild hurrahs
almost burst the roof.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, boys,’ said the C.O. quietly,
and hurried away. He was afraid of his
emotions.</p>

<p><i>Oh, we did love our dear old commandant!</i></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">NOT UNDERSTOOD.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">Do</span> not believe that we of the New Army
are blood-thirsty Bernhardis, always talking
about offensives and what not. Not a bit
of it! Ninety-nine per cent. of us loathe the
whole business, and seventy-five per cent. are
opponents of militarism. Indeed, I think we
may rightly be described as an army of pacifists
in defence of our beliefs. No decent-minded
Briton desires to compete with the brutal
philosophy of the Hun. The man who says
he likes war is either a liar or a Shylock in
the supply department. The best way to end
war is for the German nation to reduce the
German General Staff to the ranks, and let
them suffer such a bombardment as we gave
the German Tommies prior to the battle of the
Somme.</p>

<p>Shell-fire kills militarism.</p>

<p>The great New Army is a successful army,
because it has a cause. Its <i>moral</i> is largely
based on our love of freedom, truth, ease, and
peace at our own fireside. We are a peace-loving
people. A navy we have always regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
as an expensive business, the army as
a luxury, war as a d&mdash;&mdash; nuisance and a most
uncomfortable affair. War interferes with our
commerce, our studies, our games, and our
pleasures. War kills and mangles men who
have been made in the image of God. It
wrecks nations, countries, and homes; brings
into millions of lives suffering, poverty, anger,
despair, madness, and soul-racking sorrow. It
is the most foul, ghastly, ungodly thing that
man ever created.</p>

<p>War is hell&mdash;a suffering hell, a grisly hell.</p>

<p>Every man in the New Army thinks that.
And it is most important you should realise
our point of view; otherwise you will be unable
to understand our psychology, and the reason
for our carrying on. Of course, you may never
have heard that side before. You are not
to blame. Newspaper correspondents at the
front send home the most awful ‘tripe’ about
us. They actually dare to say we ‘like it.’
When we read such things we laugh. Perhaps
the poor devils are not entirely at fault.
Some bright gent who is director-general of
<i>moral</i> may consider it necessary that they
should produce this piffle. But such a view
is rather an insult to our education. We can
penetrate official camouflage, sometimes enjoy
it, but all the same this sort of stuff is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
good for the army or the nation. It breeds
illusions. Illusions of this order eventually
become a danger to the State. Much better
to speak the truth, to show war in all its vile
nakedness&mdash;show it in operation with blood,
bayonets, and a brutal barrage blowing horses
and men to bits, and motor-cars sky-high.
Britishers can face this, for we are a race of
stoics. But what Britishers cannot understand
is that extraordinary diplomacy which
says we must camouflage heavy casualties, hide
disasters, whitewash blunders, and instil in
the minds of a shivering British public that
the Front is really ‘not so bad as they say.’
The Front is a vile and a hellish place.</p>

<p>But it was the Germans who made it so.</p>

<p>That is the whole alphabet of our cause.
We are in this military business because we
hate it. The position is such that if we refuse
to fight, our lives, our homes, our businesses,
our mothers, wives, and sweethearts, will be at
the mercy of that awful devil who says he is
the image of God&mdash;the Kaiser. We must
fight, or fizzle out. Snowden, Ramsay Macdonald,
and men of that kidney are foolish
and dangerous counsellors. Their methods,
if successful, mean that Pacifism&mdash;the true
Pacifism&mdash;is dead for ever, and we should
be compelled to deify the sword and applaud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the philosophy which condones rape, murder,
burglary, and all the abominable dogmas of
Berlin.</p>

<p>And yet our instructors never took up that
line.</p>

<p>Very few of the Old Army men have
plumbed the depths of the New Army.
Privately, we think many of them are afraid
of our intellects. They seldom get down
to earth with us, and often seek refuge in
the discipline which can hold us off. They
are brave men, and, with a few exceptions,
are gentlemen. But they believe we are
swashbuckling imperialists, when in reality we
are pacifists fighting for peace <i>now</i> and&mdash;<i>for
ever</i>. The professional military mind is in
many ways admirable. It is honest, direct,
and cannot compromise. When it damns, it
damns. But it is not elastic; it takes in
slowly. Even now, after four years of war,
you will not get 50 per cent. of Old Army
men to give you a correct analysis of our
psychology. This is a pity, and accounts for
any friction of which you may hear.</p>

<p>At the school we were not understood.</p>

<p>Apparently it is considered indispensable to
give ‘the new fellows’ a lot of talk about
the King, the Empire, the Cause, and ‘the
Correct Thing.’ This is quite all right when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
presented by capable men, who will at least
recognise that we have been to school. But
when an old red-cheeked blunderbuss pops into
the school on a visit of inspection, and commences
to ladle out this stuff like a Jingo
orator on a soap-box, we squirm and silently
rebel. We hate all this empty talk. Our
King, our Empire, and ‘the Correct Thing’
have nothing to do with the making of this
war. It is the Germans’ war&mdash;the Kaiser’s
war. Lip-service is of little use to the
monarchy or the Empire. We are not flag-waggers.
We are plain, home-loving shopkeepers
in arms. We do not question the
right of King George or ignore the Empire’s
existence; but we are all determined, with
the aid of God, bayonet, and high explosive, to
root out the Kaiser, his chiefs, and all their
works, because they and their foul gospel mean
the moral ruin and the brutal domination of
the world. On enlistment, when we held up
our hands and swore by Almighty God ‘to
defend His Majesty, his heirs and successors,’
<i>we meant it</i>; but we do think that in our
terms of service there should be a contract
that we be understood.</p>

<p>For all that, you must not believe that we
New Army men resent <i>intelligent</i> discipline or
<i>intelligent</i> superiors. Oh no! We, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
have the ability to distinguish between the
system and the men who live under it. While
we hate militarism, we have a deep and lasting
affection for many of the professional soldiers.
And it is this personal bond between officers
and men that has helped to make the New
Army effective. Their views are not our
views, but their personal devotion and example
are priceless assets in such a war. Indeed,
the good officer is usually a good man. What
always impressed us was the strong religious
convictions of men like Maude, Kitchener, and
Robertson. Example is the keynote of the
true British officer. There are many instances
to prove my contention. General Maude in
Mesopotamia ordered all his officers and men
to refrain from drinking or eating anything
offered by a native. Yet, when receiving a
native deputation, who offered him the hospitality
of the country, he, like a courteous
gentleman, realising how hurt and offended
these simple natives would be if he refused,
took the proffered cup, which reeked of cholera,
and&mdash;<span class="smcap">DIED</span>. There is no greater example of
chivalry, and it is just that sort of chivalry
which has endeared the best men of the Old
Army to all in the New.</p>

<p>Again, there is that noble story of an air-raid
on London when our barrage was rotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and somebody in the War Office phoned to an
aerodrome for some one to go up.</p>

<p>‘We can’t. The weather’s against us.
It’s suicide,’ replied the air commander.</p>

<p>‘You must do something,’ was the final
order.</p>

<p>The air commander, realising that it simply
meant ordering a junior to go to his death,
went up himself, and was <span class="smcap">KILLED</span>!</p>

<p>In Mesopotamia, a naval cutter was ordered
to rush a bridge and break the boom across
the river. The commander knew it meant
death to the man who did it. So he took the
hatchet himself, jumped over the bow, and
commenced to hack at the hawsers. He was
shot <span class="smcap">DEAD</span>.</p>

<p>Now, this sort of thing, and this sort of
man, we appreciate. Personal bravery is a
quality which can stir and develop the best
in tyros at the military game. It was these
glorious soldiers who gave the New Army the
confidence to go on, the ability to stick it, and
showed us the need for some sort of discipline,
and the use of comradeship and <i>esprit de corps</i>
to effect our purpose. What I want you to
appreciate thoroughly is this: Militarism is a
hateful creed, but the military life does show
whether a man has ‘guts.’ War is not our
business as a nation, but in war we, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
are one of the toughest and bravest peoples
on earth. The forte of the New Army is its
intelligent grasp of the principles for which
we are fighting. But only one British general
has said we are out to destroy the brutal
doctrines of war.</p>

<p>That general was Sir William Robertson.</p>

<p>Now, at the school we got all sorts of
excellent technical stuff which was absolutely
necessary, and which we thoroughly appreciated.
But we did not get what I have been writing
about. We often talked about this. And all
of us were agreed that it is dangerous to
neglect the frank discussion of the principles,
the politics, and the creeds which affect a
nation in arms. War to-day is a complicated
business. An officer must not only have
mastered the technicalities of the military
profession; he must be acquainted with the
broad principles of high policy which guide
the action of his army. He must appreciate
the value of <i>moral</i>, and the need of educating
it and sustaining it. But he cannot do so if
he ignores the principles for which five millions
have enlisted. It is all very well to know how
to ‘form fours’ and ‘slope arms;’ but if an
officer cannot distinguish Hindenburg from
Liebknecht, Lloyd George from Lenin, Enver
Pasha from the simple Turk, or Clemenceau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from Bolo, then he is <span class="smcap">NOT</span> educated. This
knowledge can be given either in pamphlet
form or in a couple of lectures. At present
the voice of the New Army man is drowned
by the louder cries of ‘the old school.’</p>

<p>I am only a youthful person at this business,
but I do feel that in this great and terrible
war we should have an opportunity to pop our
ideas into a collecting-box which will be taken
direct to the War Office and opened by a
bright, sympathetic young soldier of the
General Staff.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Wilson will agree.</p>

<p>He, like General Maude, is a man of
imagination.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="pch">MOTHER COMES TO SCHOOL.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">You</span> will have noticed ere this what a
dear old soul my mater is. How tender
her love! How trusting in all things! To
an artist she is a dream-picture. So quaint,
yet so dignified; so innocent, yet so human.
When dressed in black brocade, with white
collar and cuffs, with her silver-haired ringlets
hanging on each side of her head, she looks a
charming Victorian. Just the sort of old lady
you see stepping out of an ancient picture-gallery.
She is of the past&mdash;the beautiful
past&mdash;when life was slow, yet kind and true.</p>

<p>She lives in a rustic manor in sleepy old
Berks. There she is sheltered from the
storms. Her four interests in life are <i>The
Times</i>, the Tory Party, her Wyandottes, and&mdash;<span class="smcap">ME</span>.
Whatever our modern Delanes say, my
mater endorses with emphasis. When Lloyd
George was appointed Premier, she had no
sleep for four nights; and had it not been
for the reassuring leader in <i>The Times</i>, the
mater might have been tempted to stuff a
bomb in a highly flavoured dead Wyandotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and send it to 10 Downing Street. However,
I did my best to assure her that David was
thoroughly respectable, and that his Conservative
colleagues would look after him.
That ended all opposition.</p>

<p>She has implicit faith in me. I am the
idol of her heart. This devotion is really
embarrassing. I am not worthy of it. At
school I had learnt more than the classics.
Now, the mater loathes liquor, and she has a
dread of girls. Her boy must be kept from
the hussies at all costs. In this age&mdash;indeed,
in all ages&mdash;that has been impracticable. But
it made me a sort of hypocrite, for I would
not have shattered that dear old lady’s illusions
for all the wealth of Carnegie. Yet, somehow,
I also felt that her sweet faith always kept me
within bounds. A man could not be a bounder
with a mother like Mrs John Brown. Still,
like all youths, I was having my ‘fling,’ and
out of your ‘fling’ comes strength or ruin.
Life is a series of temptations. The man who
can taste and leave them goes forward. The
man who is ensnared is damned.</p>

<p><i>We have all got to go through the mill.</i></p>

<p>As I have said, the mater is innocent in
affairs of the world, especially in military
matters. She mixes things up. For example,
an ‘offensive’ she thought was a nasty smell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
at the Front. One day she inquired, ‘John,
when are they going to make Douglas Haig a
sergeant-major? I am sure he deserves it.
Don’t you think I should write to <i>The
Times</i>?’</p>

<p>‘You mean a field-marshal, mater.’</p>

<p>‘What’s that?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, field-marshal is the highest. He
carries a baton.’</p>

<p>‘What a common thing to do!’</p>

<p>‘Why, mater?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I thought it was only stupid policemen
who did that. <i>The army is very strange,
my boy.</i>’</p>

<p>I did my best to enlighten the dear old lady,
but I had no success. When colonels and
majors came to tea, she called them corporals
or sergeants, to the enjoyment of all. They
never disillusioned her. She was such a kind
old soul. And now that I am a military
cadet, she had got the idea that I am a
most important person. She confided in Aunt
Jane’s ear that I should soon be a ‘brass hat.’</p>

<p>‘What’s that?’ asked Aunt Jane.</p>

<p>‘Oh, the pretty men who ride in front of
the band and give orders.’</p>

<p>‘How nice!’</p>

<p>Aunt Jane was mater’s youngest sister.
She was almost forty-five, unmarried, quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
fine woman to look at, and a good soul.
When I was at school she used to send me
mince-pies, plum-puddings, and cigarettes.
(Mater didn’t know about the cigarettes.)</p>

<p>The greatest weakness the old lady has is
jumping to conclusions. Like a silly ass, I
had written and said I had caught a cold on
a route march, owing to the awful weather.</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p class="pbq p1">‘<span class="smcap">My dearest Boy</span>,&mdash;How shocked I was to
hear you had got a cold on such a day! It is
abominable to think that boys are taken out
on a wet day. You might have died! I am
so annoyed about this that I have asked our
Member to put a question in the House. I
have also written to <i>The Times</i>. It is
shocking!&mdash;Your loving</p>

<p class="pbqr4"><span class="smcap">Mother</span>.’</p>

<p class="p1">When I got this I almost had apoplexy.
Something had to be done. I wired the
Member: ‘For Heaven’s sake don’t put
mother’s question! Writing.’ And I also
wired to <i>The Times</i>. That saved the situation.</p>

<p>The mater couldn’t understand war; nor did
she realise that soldiers are not mollycoddles.
She didn’t mind my dying at the Front, but
she <i>did</i> object to my getting a cold at home.
Rather a mixed-up point of view, but quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
motherly. And there are lots of mothers like
that, as I have since discovered.</p>

<p>This route march incident apparently decided
her visit to our school. Aunt Jane was invited
to accompany her. She was delighted. The
two old dears simply wired: ‘Coming to see
you. Ask the rector to let you off.’</p>

<p>The rector! How the old ‘com.’ would
have laughed if he had seen the telegram!
The mater gave me no clue as to how she
would come, or when I might expect her.
However, I knew Aunt Jane would look after
her. Meantime I asked all my pals to have
tea with the ladies at the local hotel. I
insisted particularly on Nobby’s coming, for
I knew she would like to see the Radical.</p>

<p>There was going to be fun.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was not about when they
landed. They came from the junction by
motor-car, and were deposited at the gate.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see John,’ said the mater.</p>

<p>‘Never mind! We’ll soon find him.’</p>

<p>The first man they saw was the commandant.
He was looking well that day&mdash;the picture of
a powerful mandarin. The old ladies got a
little nervous. They wondered whether the
‘com.’ was a fierce sergeant-major or a regimental
policeman. He was so impressive!
But they tackled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Can you tell me where to find the rector?
I want to see my son,’ said the mater.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid, madam, there’s no rector here,’
the old man said with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well, the manager, or whatever you
call him. I really don’t know the right
terms.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’m the commandant.’</p>

<p>‘Then you must be the head-master.’</p>

<p>‘Exactly!’ The colonel blinked. He loathed
these civilian terms.</p>

<p>‘My boy’s name is John Brown.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed! He is a very bright boy. I am
delighted to meet you. Will you ladies kindly
come into the anteroom?’ The old sport took
them into the mess and gave them afternoon
tea. Mother and Aunt Jane enjoyed this
immensely.</p>

<p>‘I hope you see my boy wears flannel next
his skin. He’s rather delicate, you know,’
ventured the old lady.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes. The boys have a platoon commander
who acts as a sort of mother. He
spanks them when they are naughty, and
tucks them up at night.’</p>

<p>‘Does John ever give you trouble?’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit! He has never been before me.
Your boy is a great credit to you. I’m awfully
proud of him. Do have some more tea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>Wasn’t the old ‘com.’ playing the game?</p>

<p>Meantime a dozen officers were scouring the
school for me. They discovered me in the
gym., having a bayonet-fight with Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Come along, Brown. Look smart! Your
mother and a friend are here.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, thanks, sir.’</p>

<p>I was across at the mess door in a jiffy. As
the tea-party was over, the ‘com.’ and the
ladies came out.</p>

<p>‘Here’s your boy, Mrs Brown. Now, off
you go. He may have leave for the day.
Good-bye.’</p>

<p>I led them away, and all I could get out
of them was, ‘What a delightful old gentleman!’
Aunt Jane was quite struck with
the commandant, and bluntly asked if he was
married.</p>

<p>‘He’s a widower.’</p>

<p>‘How interesting!’ That was all she said,
but I wondered! I wondered!</p>

<p>‘Here’s our hut, mater.’</p>

<p>As we entered Ginger and Beefy hurriedly
pushed some liqueur-bottles under the blankets,
while Tosher discreetly flung a rug over a
series of wall pictures taken out of the <i>Sketch</i>
and the <i>Tatler</i>.</p>

<p>‘This is the Reverend Billy Greens.’</p>

<p>‘How pleasant to meet you, Mr Greens!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
I am so glad you and my boy go to prayers
so often.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we are great friends,’ said Billy, tactfully
evading discussion of what really was
a ‘terminological inexactitude’ invented by
myself.</p>

<p>Ginger and Tosher were next introduced,
and then came Nobby.</p>

<p>‘Ah! I wanted to meet you, Mr Clarke.
You really don’t look like a Radical at all.
You are much too nice for that.’</p>

<p>‘I’m being converted, Mrs Brown,’ said
Nobby maliciously.</p>

<p>‘How splendid!’</p>

<p>‘What do you think of our happy home,
mater?’</p>

<p>‘Well it <i>does</i> look untidy. And what a lot
of papers and books!’ She picked up the
<i>Tatler</i>. ‘John! Do you read this?’ she said,
pointing to a wonderful picture by ‘Fish.’</p>

<p>‘Well&mdash;no, mater. The Red Cross send us
old magazines to use for shaving-papers.’</p>

<p>‘I am so glad,’ she returned.</p>

<p>I did feel a rotten hypocrite.</p>

<p>‘Now, do all of you sleep in those little
wooden things?’ pointing to the trestle-beds.</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes.’</p>

<p>‘Dear me! I thought you only got those
things in jail. Oh! What’s that?’ she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
spotting Adela’s photo over my bed.
She went nearer, and put up her pince-nez.
‘Dear, dear! A girl! A girl, John!’</p>

<p>‘An old friend, mater. She’s&mdash;she’s really
quite nice. Her uncle is a vicar.’</p>

<p>‘Does she live near here?’</p>

<p>‘Well&mdash;not quite.’</p>

<p>‘I must speak to you about this later.’
Then she turned to the boys again, and had a
pleasant chat. Meanwhile I had got two cars,
and pushed the party into them. We sailed
off to the local hotel, where we had a ripping
tea. Poor Aunt Jane wasn’t in the piece;
mother had so many things to ask my friends.
They gathered round her, and she simply
treated them as her own little boys. Even
Ginger enjoyed it. It was so natural, so
human, so much like his own dear mater, who
was&mdash;dead. Her whole concern was about
their boots, their clothing, and their spiritual
welfare. And did they write every day to
their mothers, like her own dear John? Tosher,
the materialist, fell head over ears in love
with the dear old mater. She taught him to
appreciate this fact, that the strength of the
Old Country lies in the wonderful women who
have suckled a manly and virile race. The
party was all too short, and the ladies were
sorry to go. We escorted them to the station.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Tosher, with true Canadian generosity, bought
a huge box of chocolates; Beefy presented
some flowers to Aunt Jane; and Ginger,
Nobby, and Billy loaded them up with magazines
and books.</p>

<p>‘You dear, dear boys!’ said mother.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, mater.’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, Aunt Jane,’ they all shouted as
the two dearest women in the world were
whirled away on the south express.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye, dear boys.&mdash;And, John’&mdash;&mdash; mother
shouted.</p>

<p>‘Yes, mater?’</p>

<p>‘Button up your collar&mdash;it’s cold!’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE NEW ARMY OFFICER.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">‘The</span> New Army Officer is the finest production
of the twentieth century,’ said
Captain Cheerall at one of his lectures. ‘He
is as fascinating as, frequently, he is irritating,
for he is no lover of conventions. His success
is staggering, particularly to the Germans,
and his bravery is the talk of the world. I,
of the Old Army, salute the New Crusader;
but I am sorry to say a few ancient mandarins
don’t. We have to destroy this prejudice,
or else remove all those who fail to
encourage the bright young men who have
led our platoons, companies, and regiments to
victory.</p>

<p>‘The New Officer is an Edison and a Trojan.</p>

<p>‘While I am proud of that glorious Old
Army which I saw bleeding at Mons and expiring
at Ypres, I do feel we must cease to talk
of the old and concentrate on the new. The
New Army is fighting to-day, and it is most
discouraging to our latest cavalier to remind
him continually of his temporary rank and
temporary job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That word “temporary” ought to be
silenced for ever.</p>

<p>‘The New Officer has proved that leadership
is no monopoly, and that warfare is not
difficult to master. He has exploded the
theory that it takes twenty years to make
a colonel, and forty to make a general. He
has shocked our drill-sergeants, and surprised
our Napoleons by his ruthless destruction of
shams and his nimble seizure of facts. He
is the daring, dashing, dauntless Brigadier
Gerard.</p>

<p>‘He is an optimist, and therefore successful.</p>

<p>‘If the New Officer owes a great deal to his
predecessor, his predecessor must also acknowledge
his debt. The sincerity, the enthusiasm,
the intelligence, and the business ability of the
new man have been priceless assets in this war.
What <i>would</i> this Empire have done without
the splendid fellow who chucked his wealth and
his pleasures into the dust-heap, and came to
us for a job? He was irrepressible! If his
chest was small, he bribed men to slip him
through. If his heart was diseased, it suddenly
became cured. If varicose veins were in
his legs, he had them cut out. If he was
forty or fifty, he became twenty or thirty.
And if he hadn’t experience, he always said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>“I’ll d&mdash;&mdash; soon learn.”</p>

<p>‘He was a blood-thirsty crusader.</p>

<p>‘Now, when he joined we were mournful.
We looked at him and sighed. “The correct
thing,” somehow or other, wasn’t in his keeping.
He was inclined to call the colonel
“Alf” and the sergeant-major “Bill.” He
didn’t know! And, oh dear&mdash;his word of
command! It was so respectable&mdash;so tame!
He seemed to apologise to the troops for his
presence&mdash;yea, his very existence. Yet he was
a sticker. He was cursed from dawn till sunset.
In those early days he was occasionally
insulted and abused. There was a war on,
and we regarded him as shell-fodder, and not
as human. Let us apologise now. We were
worried. The Old Army was dying. The
Huns were knocking at the gates, and we,
with our old conservative ideas, regarded him
as a forlorn hope, and sometimes as “a wash-out.”</p>

<p>‘How wrong, how terribly unjust, we
were!</p>

<p>‘But he always said, “Yes, sir.” He always
smiled. His trust was embarrassing, and his
docility staggering. To us, his masters, jailers,
and martinets, he yielded a homage which
made us feel like gods. His very willingness
made us misjudge him and think him a fool.
“No guts” was a term frequently on our lips.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
We, with the vanity of the old and tried,
could not see that he was of our blood, our
faith, our schooling, our patriotism, and our
pride. Of these virtues we imagined we had
the monopoly. What insolence! What fools
we were!</p>

<p>‘But we were worried about the war.</p>

<p>‘In those anxious, awful days we had no
rifles, no uniforms, no equipment to spare;
no brass bands, no flashing swords or coloured
fripperies of rank and standing. Yet this
amazing youth was undaunted. He shoved
dummy guns into the hands of his platoon,
made trenches with fire-shovels and trowels,
used <i>living</i> brigadiers for targets, and gave the
command, “At the enemy&mdash;at four hundred&mdash;fire!”
The brigadiers woke up and&mdash;smiled.
The imagination of the New Officer was
helpful. He could talk, for he was educated.
And he pictured German armies on the move,
German hordes at the double, and to meet
them roused his civvy-clad platoon to the
heights of devilry and daring, then charged
with his little bamboo cane&mdash;to glory.</p>

<p>‘By Gad! he always won.</p>

<p>‘Even then we doubted him. We somehow
felt he wouldn’t “pan out.” Most excellent
for the Boys’ Brigade, or the like; but for
a war&mdash;well, we should see! At last the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
uniforms came, the rifles too; but somebody
forgot the ammunition. He said, “Oh, that’s
the bally War Office again. Let’s carry on
with these dummy clips.” Standing, lying,
kneeling, and sitting, he taught the wonders of
rapid fire, and how to make a “group” on
the square head of the pimple-dotted Boche.
Jules Verne wasn’t in it! His men made
bull’s-eyes on the colonel’s tummy, and
riddled the nether regions of the twenty-stone
quartermaster.</p>

<p>‘Then we called him a ruddy swanker.</p>

<p>‘For all that, he went on. The fellow was
clean mad to “get out.” We said, “Yes, when
we’ve put you through the mill.” And we
did! We froze him on the ranges; soaked
him on parade; tore his feet on the route
march; and almost broke the valves of his
heart charging mountains, and doubling for
miles in heavy marching order. But he stuck
it, and when he came in, stood us a drink, and
said, “D&mdash;&mdash; it all, do send us to the
Front, sir!”</p>

<p>‘We commenced to think he wasn’t bad.</p>

<p>‘And then he started to think and to do
things, for he felt his feet on firmer ground.
Red tape he damned. For example, he got
fed up ending his letters: “I have the honour
to be, sir, your obedient servant, <span class="smcap">William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Winkie</span>.” And he introduced this reform:
“Yours truly, <span class="smcap">W. Winkie</span>.”</p>

<p>‘We were shocked, of course. The other
had been done since the time of Moses. This
was a most atrocious outrage against the all-holy
conventions. An explanation was immediately
demanded&mdash;in writing. He replied:
“I’m a business man, and there’s a war on.”</p>

<p>‘The old brigadier expired with apoplexy.</p>

<p>‘His brevity was startling. Instead of
replying, “I beg to acknowledge receipt of
yours,” &amp;c., he simply stated, “Received, noted,
and filed.”</p>

<p>‘But he did a more startling thing. He
actually dethroned the pen and brought the
typewriter into the company office. He also
enlisted his shorthand clerk, and purchased a
small card-index system, with which he created
a little bureau, labelled: “Accounts,” “Equipment,”
“Correspondence.”</p>

<p>‘This had never been done by the best
people, for we always thought it very bad
form to make the army business-like. If our
fathers had sold shirts, beer, or bacon, we never
mentioned it. And we had always been most
careful to hide away the prompt, precise,
methodical methods of our wealthy parents.
We worshipped “form” and hated facts. But
this fellow day after day continued, quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
but effectively, to cut out all the appalling
bluff and nonsense of centuries. We didn’t
like this&mdash;at first. Indeed, the ancient adjutant,
trained in the methods of Wellington and
the Duke of Cambridge, took seriously ill, and&mdash;retired.</p>

<p>‘The C.O. turned in despair to the New
Officer.</p>

<p>‘“I’ll take it on, sir,” he said, “but I must
have an absolutely free hand.”</p>

<p>‘“Why?”</p>

<p>‘“Well, I’m a business man.”</p>

<p>‘He was so persuasive about his methods
that he was permitted to get his foot inside the
orderly-room door. Then he shoved his whole
personality into it. With a sweep of his pen
he returned all the elderly red-tape clerks to
duty. In came his shorthand clerks, typewriter,
card-index, and books on “system.”
There was a bonfire of ancient rubbish, and the
erection of neat shelves, methodically arranged
and labelled: “Training,” “Finance,” “Correspondence,”
“Records,” “Blunders,” “Results.”</p>

<p>‘The C.O. was astonished at the peace,
smoothness, and efficiency. He was also
amused when the new adjutant suggested that
he (the C.O.) might dictate all his letters to
the shorthand clerk. “Saves time, sir, and
will let you get out to see what is going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>.”
The Old Man had a shot at this. He discovered
that he need only spend half-an-hour
on correspondence instead of <i>three hours</i>.</p>

<p>‘Result: he was always on parade, and
<i>training improved</i>.</p>

<p>‘Secretly we admired all this, but some of
us got jealous. We grew petty, and showed it
in our memos. But he called us up, and said,
“Look here, Tom, Dick, and Harry, I’m not
here for my health. I’m here for business.
If you don’t like my methods, you had better
move to another battalion.”</p>

<p>‘And the old C.O. backed him up.</p>

<p>‘At last we voiced our true thoughts, and
said, “The New Man is an organiser. He
can do things. And he does save us a tremendous
lot of trouble with the paymaster,
the Command, and the War Office.” Having
paid this homage, we started to go to him for
advice on administration. He gave us heaps.</p>

<p>‘But we still wondered how he would “pan
out” in the field.</p>

<p>‘Next, we went out. The New Man was
told to entrain the battalion at the station,
where a train would be in waiting. When he
got there he discovered the R.T.O. had forgotten&mdash;the
luggage-vans. He asked no questions,
but collared two vans on the siding, had
them hitched on to the train, loaded up, shoved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the troops in, reported “All correct,” and we
started to move.</p>

<p>‘“What the devil do you mean taking those
vans?” roared the annoyed R.T.O.</p>

<p>‘“You go and learn your business, sonny.
I’m a railway manager. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>‘We lay back and simply roared with
laughter.</p>

<p>‘Crossing the Channel, we of the old school
were just a bit worried. We had grown to
like the new fellow an awful lot. He was so
willing, so decent, so obliging, and so keen.
Still, we did think he was not quite the type.
His business abilities were admirable. But
what about leadership?</p>

<p>‘This problem had yet to be solved.</p>

<p>‘However, we plugged into the trenches,
and he started on his new job. He was
“jumpy” a little, and felt at sea. But he
was a sticker. Above all, he was cheerful.
He kept the men happy&mdash;fought like a devil
with the quartermaster about his company’s
rations, saw to the rum, stole wood for his
men’s fires, robbed the A.S.C. of coal and
coke, made braziers out of biscuit-boxes, and
organised concerts under heavy bombardments.
He wasn’t afraid to grouse, but he never bucked
at a job.</p>

<p>‘We did feel immensely grateful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Next, the great offensive. What a day!
The barrage of the enemy was sheer murder;
but he leaped over the bags like a fine British
gentleman, and kept his eye on the <span class="smcap">OBJECTIVE</span>.
The C.O. was killed, the major was killed,
company commanders were wounded, and the
New Man found he was alone.</p>

<p>‘<i>His hour had come.</i></p>

<p>‘Some weak fool shouted, “Retire!” but
the New Man clapped a revolver to the
demoralised man’s ear and said, “Go on.”
He went! The weaker were impressed; the
brave were thrilled. Old Army sergeants
vowed he was “the goods,” and loyally backed
him up. And on through hell, through death,
and a blood-soaked shambles went the New
Crusader with his battalion. The objective
was reached, but we had only three hundred
men instead of a thousand. There were no
bombs, little ammunition, no water, no rations,
and the men were <i>absolutely done</i>. All round
were the bursting shells, the spluttering
maxims, the choking gas, and the agonies of
war. His flanks were in the air, but he extended
his thin line, sent back the runners,
dug in, and opened fire.</p>

<p>‘On came the Germans.</p>

<p>‘But the God of all men was on his side.
Providence protects the brave. His fame had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
trickled down the line, and anxious generals
vowed he <i>would</i> be supported. Company after
company was slaughtered in the attempt.
Then up came the Guards&mdash;the flower of
British chivalry. The Old Crusaders were
determined that the New would not be surrounded,
jabbed, and crucified. Through that
cruel barrage they tramped as if on parade.</p>

<p>‘And while they were advancing, the New
Man, though weary, wounded, and blood-stained,
was fighting a dauntless battle. Three
hundred men had dropped to two hundred.
His flanks were burst. He was almost surrounded.
The bayonets of Potsdam were
glittering at his breast, but he cried, “Fight
on&mdash;fight on! No damn surrender to these
Huns!”</p>

<p>‘“Ay, ay, sir,” responded his glorious men.</p>

<p>‘Just as the mad finale was reached, when
the fate of the New Man and his heroic
battalion seemed sealed, a cheer burst on the
air, and the Guards broke through. The Old
and the New joined hands, then fought the
Hun with cold steel till he squealed like a pig
and&mdash;<span class="smcap">RAN</span>.</p>

<p>‘Four Guardsmen carried the New Man
down the line.</p>

<p>‘And then the world&mdash;and the Old Army&mdash;woke
up. The chivalry of ages was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
New Cavalier. His battered and bleeding
form was carried through a guard of honour
to the place where the sick are healed. Women
sent him flowers; old generals paid him
homage; and, like a true Britisher, he inquired,
“What’s all the fuss about? It wasn’t
I&mdash;it was the <span class="smcap">MEN</span>.”</p>

<p>‘But the King gave him the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>‘The Guards presented arms.</p>

<p>‘The Old Army cheered.</p>

<p>‘And the world said, “Well done!”</p>

<p>‘I salute the New Army Officer,’ concluded
Captain Cheerall.</p>

<p>The school jumped to its feet and almost
went mad with cheering.</p>

<p><i>Why don’t we have more lectures like that?</i></p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="pch">STEADY OLD ADELA.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">‘Leave</span>, boys; leave!’ shouted Beefy one
night, rushing in with battalion orders
in his hand.</p>

<p>‘When is it?’ Ginger asked.</p>

<p>‘Next week.’</p>

<p>‘How long do we get, Beefy?’ I inquired.</p>

<p>‘Four days, my boys&mdash;four priceless days
of priceless fun. Cheero!’ he concluded,
throwing his cap in the air.</p>

<p>This was excellent news. Leave is our
greatest joy in the army. At once we commenced
to plan out days of fun and nights of
glory. All were rather secret about their
arrangements. They were scheming out timetables
in which not one lady but many were
involved. Nobby, however, confided to me
that he was going off to see rather a pretty
widow. She was good fun, and had lots of
brass. (Nobby was after the brass.) Beefy
whispered that he had a wonderful woman in
Cambridge, and another in Bath. He was
going to see <i>both</i>. Tosher, thoroughly practical,
decided to investigate the claims of Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
girls, and see whether a Scottish wife would
be a sound investment for his dollars and his
affections. Even Billy, the padre, was after a
girl&mdash;a V.A.D. commandant, slightly over the
popular age, but ‘a fine woman, a fine woman,’
as Billy confidentially remarked. Ginger announced
that he was going to have a quiet
holiday at the Sweetville Hotel. I said
nothing, but thought of&mdash;the barmaid.</p>

<p>My own arrangements were not decided.
Like that of every soldier, my visiting list
was rather heavy, and in my address-book
were the names of pre-war charmers and war
charmers. To see them all was quite impossible.
Fours days did not allow of that.
Like a sub-editor, I had ‘to cut down,’ and
eventually arrived at a very brief, yet interesting,
programme. Having learnt something
about organisation at the school, I knew how
essential it was that there should be no hitch.
So I sent off the following telegrams:</p>

<p class="p1">These replies came in one by one, and each
was like a <span class="smcap">bomb</span>. Truly, the war had upset
things, and khaki provided a terrific opposition.
I was mad, I may tell you. Like the others,
I had invested in a first-class sleeping-berth on
the London Express, and had arranged for a
royal luncheon with the boys <i>en route</i>. Now
the whole scheme had fizzled out. Of course,
I could have gone to see the dear old mater;
but as I had told her such a ‘whopper,’ this
would have been rather embarrassing. Wasn’t
it rotten bad luck? Molly Charming running
a staff-captain; Phyllis Plunger in the
W.A.A.C.’s; Jeanette, of wonderful memory,
in a convent; and Gladys Sprightly actually
linked to an army chaplain! I <i>did</i> feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
offended. Of course, there was Adela&mdash;steady
old Adela. She was only five miles away, and
she was dying to see me. But I didn’t want
to go, for the very plain reason that she
wanted me to come. Whether you agree or
not, that is the attitude of the average man.
When the Blue Bird of Happiness is in his
hand, he does not want it. His eyes look
away and afar. Man always desires to chase
the unknown, to court the uncertain, and
fritter away his time and his manhood pursuing
the bubbles and the maddening mirage.</p>

<p>‘You look glum, John,’ remarked Beefy
that night.</p>

<p>‘Yes. My scheme has fizzled out.’</p>

<p>‘You’re a silly ass.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Hang it all! you wire women, asking to
see them. That isn’t the plan. You don’t
understand the dear girls.’</p>

<p>‘Well, old Bluebeard, what would you do?’</p>

<p>‘I simply wire: “Coming to see you. Meet
me at So-and-so&mdash;certain.” That’s all! They
turn up all right. <i>It’s an order.</i> Women
love to be ordered about. When you start to
say “please,” they think you’re a bally old fool.
I’m getting fed up trying to educate you,’
concluded Beefy, going off.</p>

<p>On this subject Beefy <i>was</i> an authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>However, I decided to go and see Adela.
When all the boys had left I jumped on my
bike, and in a short time was sitting in the
lovely old garden. It was a charming day.
High in the heavens the sun shone gloriously.
The earth was a panorama of pastoral beauty,
and above The Grange garden birds and bees
went blithely on their way. Everything was
restful. Everything seemed clean. And I
thought it a much better atmosphere than
the fug of a London lounge or the sooty
surroundings of Oxford Street. And yet there
was a longing for the lights that glitter, and
the women who <i>understand</i>. I was only a
boy, and just human. My virtues and vices
were not entirely formed. One day I could
with ease have become a parson; next, I
wanted&mdash;’to risk it.’ Heredity tells. I had
the blood of parsons, soldiers, and dreamers
in my veins. In my soul God and the Devil
were always struggling for victory. I was the
mere tool of moods and passions which had
been handed on.</p>

<p>We are all like that.</p>

<p>Then I looked at Adela. She was reclining
in an Oriental hammock reading a book, and
between-times picking up a chocolate. She
looked calm and restful, without nerves, and
with a suggestion of decision in her pose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Adela was not so fetching as a ballet-girl, or
so charming as one of those creatures of
Mayfair. London women are very hard
to beat in the little things which captivate
and enthral. Their experience is gained in a
cosmopolitan world. They talk with the intellectuals
and dance with the fools. And
they can charm both.</p>

<p>Adela was of the soil, the fresh, clean-smelling
earth which breeds health and
strength, and few illusions. She had no
tricks, no little bag with a puff for her nose,
or the dainty fads of millinery to enhance her
complexion or form. Plain skirt, plain blouse,
neat stockings, and well-cut shoes. And yet
she was well dressed. The girl of taste is not
a bag of glad rags. But the real charm of
Adela lay in her magnificent physique, and in
her personality.</p>

<p>Adela was different.</p>

<p>No man can define a woman’s personality.
It is as baffling as it is alluring. And what
I wondered about was this: Adela knew me,
yet I didn’t know Adela. A man is an
open book even to a schoolgirl. She can find
him out in ten minutes, but you will never
find a girl out in a thousand years. A man
hates this. It is rather an insult to his
intellect, but it is a woman’s secret and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
strength. She knows it, and she uses it,
sometimes in a very cruel way, as history
proves. Still, it is a gift of nature with which
Providence has endowed the sex, which for
centuries has been in chains.</p>

<p>Adela was young. Yet she was ‘old.’</p>

<p>‘Johnnie,’ she said, putting down her book
and looking at me, ‘why didn’t you go to the
tailor?’</p>

<p>I had been waiting for that question, so
promptly pulled the telegrams out of my
pocket, and said, ‘That’s why,’ as I put them
in her hand. It was a brutal thing to do, but
it was a fair thing. The dons had always
insisted on my speaking the truth. Not a
bad rule, but quite a rotten scheme with the
average girl.</p>

<p>Insincerity has always been popular.</p>

<p>Her brows contracted as she read each reply,
and I noted her breast heaving with suspense.
She read them over about a dozen times, then,
folding them up, handed them back with the
remark, ‘I thought so!’</p>

<p>‘Why did you?’</p>

<p>‘You are all the same.’</p>

<p>‘But aren’t girls good at the game?’</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;some are. Others are different; at
least, a few are.’</p>

<p>‘You are posing, Adela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘No, Johnnie! I like you, but I can do
without you. I haven’t much admiration for
that sort of thing.’</p>

<p>‘If I hadn’t shown them to you, you
wouldn’t have known.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, I should. I know you. You are
quite a nice boy, but, like all nice boys, you’ve
been spoiled. Girls have thrown themselves
at you, and you think you may go on like that
to the end of the chapter. Nevertheless, I’m
rather interested in you.’</p>

<p>‘But, Adela, if, as you say, you expected
this, why were you so pressing in your
invitation? Why did you want to be “one
of the crowd”?’</p>

<p>‘The maternal instinct.’</p>

<p>‘But you are competing with them.’</p>

<p>‘Not at all, old boy; I’m doing salvage-work.
I’m giving you a breath of fresh air
in this beautiful garden; then afternoon tea;
next a game of golf; in the evening a stroll
over the Downs, with just a kiss or two,
without messing you up with rouge or powder.
If, after that, you feel that the dolls of Bond
Street want you, you must go; for then I’ll
know you’re a decadent, hopelessly neurotic,
and bound to end up&mdash;a fool.’</p>

<p>‘Where did you learn all this, Adela?’ I
said, getting interested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s an instinct, and, of course, I use my
eyes. We girls have been to school, you
know.’</p>

<p>‘The war has made you think, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘The war, Johnnie, is messing things up.
Women are making themselves cheap. They
mean well. They want the boys to have a
good time, but both are getting burnt in the
process. You have learnt too much in France.’</p>

<p>‘But we knew these things before the war,
Adela.’</p>

<p>‘The war, Johnnie, has made them fashionable&mdash;that’s
the difference. Shell-fire makes
you boys neurotic. Your nerves want soothing.
But you all go the wrong way about it. It’s
fresh air and porridge you need, not giggling
Jennies, who degrade your manhood.’</p>

<p>‘But, hang it all, Adela! if we’re beating a
brute like the Boche, we can’t be hopelessly
decadent. You read things in the papers.
You’ve got too much time to think. If you
saw the soul of the army, you’d know we are
at least “not bad.”’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps. But why don’t you all stick to
your games?’</p>

<p>‘We try, but you women upset the balance.
All the trouble in this world is due either to
wine or to women. You’re sent to try us,
and sometimes you smash us. Despite that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Adela, you are all very charming. And, to be
short, if you hadn’t been decent, I shouldn’t
have come to-day. Let’s have tea.’</p>

<p>‘Right, you old darling!’ she whispered into
my ear as she tumbled out of the hammock.
Then she set out a dainty table, the maid
brought the tea, and, under the arms of some
old, waving chestnut-trees, we munched a refreshing
snack. We didn’t talk much. I was
enjoying the scenery, and the presence of
Adela; while Her Royal Highness was no
doubt wondering what extraordinary creatures
we fellows are.</p>

<p>‘Now, Johnnie, I think we’ll cut the golf,
and go over the Downs instead.’</p>

<p>‘Any old thing for a quiet life,’ I said, rising.</p>

<p>She got her stick, called her favourite dogs,
and away we went across the sweet-smelling
fields, where the bees hummed in the clover,
and the larks sang high overhead. The air
was stimulating, the surrounding country
beautiful; while the presence of Adela added
the final touch to a rustic dream. It was
sporting. It was healthy. It was clean.
The spirit of romance was there, and the poetic
side of my nature was roused to its heights.
I certainly did feel that the green vales of the
Old Land, and the <i>real</i> girls of the Old Land,
were indeed our best possessions. Somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the whole thing appeared to me as a sort of
moral lesson, as well as a silent sermon on
patriotism.</p>

<p>I became prouder of my country.</p>

<p>I felt <i>decent</i> with Adela.</p>

<p>And so we ambled along, drinking in the
joys of nature, and chatting of many things.
It wasn’t the smart talk of Mayfair, in which
I was an expert. It was just straight, frank,
none-of-your-damn-nonsense kind, in which we
looked at things with our eyes, and not through
rose-coloured glasses. And you can talk about
many things, once barred, without loss of
modesty or self-respect. After all, education
has spread. And if education can bring a
man and a woman together on an equal plane,
our country must benefit. A man wants a
girl for a chum, a confidante, and a lifelong
companion, and not as a serf, a housekeeper,
and just&mdash;<span class="smcap">A COOK</span>.</p>

<p>Yes, that was a memorable day in my life,
and it was near the turning-point. The school,
with all its deficiencies, was making its mark;
while Adela was working hard, although I
didn’t notice it at the time. From the dear
old commandant, too, I had gained the spirit
of tolerance and the milk of human kindness.
Captain Cheerall had also stirred me to probe
and analyse the human soul; while my comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had given me the joys of friendship and
the value of understanding.</p>

<p>John Brown was beginning to be&mdash;<span class="smcap">A MAN</span>.</p>

<p>After the walk, we had dinner with the
family. The mother was a delightful old lady,
full of good-nature and shrewd common-sense.
The father was equally pleasant; but Winnie,
the sister, was down in the depths. She was
thinking of Beefy&mdash;dear, kind-hearted, devil-may-care,
old Beefy.</p>

<p>Women always love the daring Don Juans.</p>

<p>‘Let me help you,’ said Adela, as I took
my coat from the stand about half-past ten.</p>

<p>‘Thanks, old girl.’</p>

<p>She lifted it on, then took my arm down
the drive. When we got to the gate, she
remarked, ‘Johnnie, I want you to do something.’</p>

<p>‘What, Adela?’</p>

<p>‘Give me those telegrams.’</p>

<p>‘With pleasure,’ I said, handing them over.
‘But what are you going to do with them?’</p>

<p>‘Burn them,’ she answered, striking a match
and lighting them there and then. As the
last telegram flickered out she kissed me good-night,
and said, ‘Do try to be a sensible boy,
John Brown.’</p>

<p>Next day I bought the engagement-ring.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">GENERAL POM-POM.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">The</span> worst of being in a cadet school is
the number of inspections you have.
Inspectors for trench warfare, gas, bayonet-fighting,
administration, general training, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., keep popping in. Each man believes that
his branch is <i>It</i>, and should you fail to come
up to his requirements, then there’s a bad
report, a thousand curses, and lots of trouble.
All the same, this is absolutely necessary, and
keeps specialists and instructors up to the
scratch. The greatest defect is this: these
people frequently ask for suggestions, but
generally fail to back them up. This, I imagine,
is due to the apathy of a higher authority, or
the obtrusion of the inspector’s own point of
view. We often talked about this, and our
view was that all cadet-school instructors
ought to form a corporate body, and demand
‘the goods.’ By the way, it was whispered
that one real good W.O. man was named
Browne. He, it is said, invariably endeavoured
to get the schools whatever they wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Good old Browne!</p>

<p>We always liked the visits from the younger
men of the staff. They were so bright, so
business-like, and they <i>did</i> take an interest in
all we were doing. Many gave us valuable
tips, which were much appreciated. Indeed,
were it not for these smarter men, military
training would be in a muddle. They are
being allowed fair scope; but if the powers
that be would only sack all the old foozlers
who are tottering round the various districts
and home commands, life would indeed be
brighter, and training would be pushed along
by the younger men, who at present cannot
get full play for all their splendid ideas. We
of the New Army belong to the New School.
We are willing to learn from a duke or a
pauper, but the teacher must have <span class="smcap">BRAINS</span>.
We are not concerned about seniority or
foolish traditions. We are out to win this
war in the speediest manner possible.</p>

<p>I also think it is a great pity that we never
saw <i>real</i> generals. We longed for a lecture
from Robertson, French, Haig, Allenby, Birdwood,
and all the other good fellows who have
done so well. We never had one. Of course,
such men are doing bigger things at the Front;
but some are at home, and others frequently
cross the Channel. We would have pawned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
our shirts to go and hear them, for we do
admire them. Certainly we got their ideas in
the form of pamphlets. But what’s a pamphlet
compared to the living man? A mere
shadow, and not at all impressive. I am
writing this, of course, for a definite purpose.
The W.O. will see these lines long before
John Brown’s book is published, and something,
I know, will be done. They always
do things in the army when they see them in
<span class="smcap">PRINT</span>.</p>

<p>After all, what is the use of sending old
dug-out generals to talk to cadet schools?
Some are nice old gentlemen who have done
well in Ashanti or on the Frontier&mdash;<i>in the
past</i>. Others, again, are petty-minded old
fools, who simply upset the instructors and
give the cadets a thin time. They may be
jolly good disciplinarians, and all that sort of
thing; but we got our discipline from the best
source (a Guards sergeant-major); and when
we saw a general, we did expect him to talk
sensibly about the war, and not about clean
buttons, pipeclay, hair-cuts, and the proper
way to stand to attention.</p>

<p>Brass bands and pipeclay never win a war.</p>

<p>Still, some of these ancient mandarins gave
us fun. For example, old General Pom-Pom,
who was in a bath-chair in August 1914,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
suddenly found himself elevated to an active
job. His great stunt was the carrying of a
drill-book in his hand. This was his authority,
and Heaven help the man who deviated from
the official path! Unless an officer was prepared
to slay the Boche according to the text-book,
he declared we should lose the ruddy
war. He was kept on. Not that the Higher
Command had any great belief in him, but
no doubt because they imagined he would
frighten the life out of the ‘undisciplined’ stuff
who were carrying swords and sporting pips,
especially one pip; for one pip was the sign
of all that is reckless, careless, inefficient, &amp;c.,
according to General Pom-Pom.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>But we got to know him. Every unit had
a secret-service agent in his office, and when
he decided to make a raid on some poor,
‘unsuspecting’ C.O., a little bird whispered
that General Pom-Pom was <i>en route</i>.</p>

<p>Out came the whitewash, pipeclay, blanco,
brasso, greasy paste, and ‘soldier’s friend.’
Pioneers whitewashed every post&mdash;not forgetting
the Last Post&mdash;and slapped the stuff
all round the walls and the doors of the
billets.</p>

<p>Pom-Pom was a devil for whitewash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The band was hauled out by the hair of the
head to practise the general salute, while all
the men were hustled to get everything shining
and&mdash;in line. Even the dixies in the cook-houses
had to be drawn up according to the
style laid down by army architects. Before
General Pom-Pom was half-way to the unit,
the men were being moved about the square
like perfect machines (he loved that), the band
was playing ‘The British Grenadiers,’ and
every officer, including the C.O. and the
adjutant, were tropically busy on the square.</p>

<p>Pom-Pom galloped on parade. ‘Morning,
colonel; morning. What’s the scheme to-day?’</p>

<p>‘Ceremonial drill, sir. The companies are
just being exercised; then I’m going to work
the battalion.’</p>

<p>‘Excellent! Excellent! Nothing like ceremonial
stuff for these fellows. Makes ‘em
smart! Makes ‘em smart! By Jove! your
band plays well. Reminds me of old days.
Good to hear ‘em! Good to hear ‘em! Let’s
see your battalion show now, colonel.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir.’</p>

<p>The battalion was mustered, during which
the C.O. would tactfully ask old General
Pom-Pom if he would kindly take post at
the saluting base.</p>

<p>‘Certainly! Certainly!’ and off he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
trot to the flag-pole. There he sat on his old
bus-horse, pouting like a pigeon, and studying
his wonderful shadow on the ground. The
men, of course, were quite interested. Pom-Pom
was, on the whole, very popular with
the troops, and they <i>did</i> love to swank to
the tune of ‘The British Grenadiers.’</p>

<p>The band played.</p>

<p>Down came the battalion like a perfect
machine. The general straightened himself
again.</p>

<p>‘Battalion&mdash;eyes right!’ roared the colonel.
The heads came round with a click, and the
general saw one thousand cheery, sun-tanned
faces.</p>

<p>‘Splendid, men! Splendid! You can beat
the Guards any day.’</p>

<p>They stalked past as proud as dukes.</p>

<p>Next the C.O. formed them into line; and
one thousand well-scrubbed Tommies, with
buttons and bayonets glistening, advanced in
review order.</p>

<p>‘Battalion&mdash;halt! General salute&mdash;present
arms!’</p>

<p>‘<i>Ta&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;talee, Tiddle&mdash;um&mdash;tum&mdash;talee</i>,’
went the bugles.</p>

<p>‘Battalion&mdash;slope arms! Order&mdash;arms!’</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Magnificent!</span>’ roared Pom-Pom. This
shout of praise could be heard miles away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Then he toddled round the billets. His eye
caught the whitewash, saw the neat kits, and
the cooks’ dixies&mdash;<i>all in line</i>.</p>

<p>‘That’s all! That’s all, colonel! I’m
very pleased! I congratulate you on your
excellent unit. Morning! Morning!’ And
off he galloped on his bus-horse.</p>

<p>The colonel smiled and faded away.</p>

<p>General Pom-Pom came to our school one
day. He went through the same performance.
Even Ginger borrowed my Vinolia to have a
wash. Pom-Pom stumped on to the parade
in a way that shook the earth, looked at us
very keenly, and muttered, ‘Good stuff!
Good stuff!’</p>

<p>One of his ideas was that a company officer
must know the name of every man in his
company. While he was inspecting our company
he arrived at me.</p>

<p>‘What’s this man’s name?’ he asked Captain
Bloggs.</p>

<p>‘Eh? Smith, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Is that right?’ he inquired of me.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir,’ I replied with emphasis. I
wouldn’t have let our company officer down for
worlds. After all, it is a good deed to keep
an old general happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Where’s your pull-through?’ he asked
Tosher.</p>

<p>‘I guess it’s broken, general.’</p>

<p>‘No d&mdash;&mdash; guessing for me, my lad. Get
it mended and shove it in your butt-trap.’</p>

<p>We enjoyed this immensely, and felt that
General Pom-Pom could beat Tosher any day.</p>

<p>‘Are you married?’ he asked Billy Greens,
who was always rather pale and carried a
worried look.</p>

<p>‘No, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What are you in civil life?’</p>

<p>‘A curate, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Thought so! Thought so!’ he said, passing
on.</p>

<p>We all grinned.</p>

<p>‘Ah! You’re a musician, aren’t you?’ he
inquired of a youth with lustrous locks.</p>

<p>‘No, sir&mdash;a Socialist!’</p>

<p>‘And you’re fighting?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What for?’</p>

<p>‘To destroy militarism.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ ... The general hurried away.</p>

<p>After the inspection he gave us a few words.
Not much intellectual food, but a lot about
the bayonet.</p>

<p>‘At ‘em when you see ‘em come. Give it
‘em hot. The short jab in the chin, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
smart thrust in the paunch. They loathe it!
They’re afraid of it! The bayonet will win
the war,’ he concluded.</p>

<p>On the whole we enjoyed his visit, and
agreed that General Pom-Pom was good
fun, kind-hearted, loyal, intensely patriotic&mdash;but
not the man to win the war.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">‘THE BOYS.’</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">One</span> thing the school, the war, and my
regiment developed; that was a love of
my comrades&mdash;’The Boys.’ What a delightful
term! So human! So reminiscent of youth
and fun and joy! Each day strengthened this
love, till it became almost a passion. This was
the true Democracy, for ‘The Boys’ have no
social measures, only the simple standards of
Faith, Hope, and Charity. When such comradeship
is allied to regimental <i>esprit de corps</i>,
there is created a <i>moral</i> which is invincible.
Whatever pain and sorrow the war has brought
me, I always gloried in this meeting of the
waters. Stripped of the masks created by politicians
and Who’s-Who snobs, we discovered
common aims, common interests, and common
ties of affection. Ginger Thomson, the hide-bound
prophet of Imperialism, was the sworn
comrade of Nobby Clarke, the ramping, raging
lion of the Free Trade school; Tosher, the
wild Canadian, walked arm-in-arm with Billy,
the sweet and refined; and I, the dreamer,
plugged along with Beefy, the full-chested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Balzac of the camp. In our little hut we
ragged with good feeling, and all seemed to
look for an opportunity to do a good turn, like
the proverbial Boy Scout. It was a manly,
a noble, phase of life. Selfishness was absent.
Love was triumphant.</p>

<p>But, oh, the sadness and the madness of
the scheme! While our love was being developed,
we were training to die. Now, death
is nothing. But to one who loves mankind
it seemed a scheme of the very devil to breed
such god-like men for the shambles. Here
were the cream of the race, the flower of
strength, the pick of intellect, supermen&mdash;with
the hand of Death upon them. But
that is war as the Kaiser willed it. By a
stroke of his pen this proud, inhuman monarch
has caused the death and the madness of
millions. Oh, cruel monster! If there be a
God, then his punishment is assured.</p>

<p>Often I thought of this aspect of war. At
night there passed before me the ghosts of
my dead comrades&mdash;line after line of clean-limbed,
open-eyed, fresh-faced heroes of battle.
I had marched with them, supped with them,
danced with them. Their lives were an open
book. No deceit. No camouflage of the roué
or the sneak. Their dreams, their loves, their
passions, good and bad, I had known. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
few were saints in any sense of the term, none
were hardened sinners. Their patriotism and
self-sacrifice had ennobled them. And they
had gone&mdash;gone, I believe, to higher and better
realms. But what a passage! Crucified on
the altar of <i>Kultur</i>&mdash;gassed, bludgeoned,
mangled, tortured, and maddened by the German
rules of war. I had seen them go; seen
them fall in the trench, with that groan which
tears the heart; seen them stagger back while
attempting to go over the top. And in that
awful No Man’s Land, where bullets hum like
dragon-flies, and shells scream like drunken
sirens, I had seen them stagger, clutch, and
writhe in the agony of death.</p>

<p>How true they were! How brave! And
of every class and calling. Duke’s son and
cook’s son, charging, cheering, fighting, and
dying in the breach. Ah, how glad I was to
have met them, but how sad to part! True,
they have not died in vain, but they have
left on me, a youth, marks akin to those of
sorrowful old age. I was haunted by their
eyes, sometimes unnerved when I thought of
their screams. And yet I was proud. They
had played the game; played it as no troops
of Clive or Wellington were ever asked to
play it; played it against the most brutal foe
this world has ever seen. Your Trojans and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
your Spartans are mere tyros compared with
our men to-day. Far better to be clubbed
and speared than suffer the horrors and the
madness of modern war.</p>

<p>When I thought of this murdered manhood,
the slaughtered genius, and the wiping out
of such noble sires, I felt afraid&mdash;afraid for
the Old Land, the Old Flag, the Old Home
by the hillside. Would all these things
remain? Could we still carry on? Would
the hog-like Huns, who breed as the vulgar
always breed, be able to win ‘the war after
the war’? Beaten in the field, robbed of
victory, would this coarse-grained tribe cunningly
exploit the survivors of a finer race?
I wondered. For this is a serious aspect of
the war. There was no conclusion to my
musings, but somehow I did believe that Providence
protects the clean. The empires of
Hannibal, Nero, Napoleon, and the Romanoffs
are no more. They outraged the laws of
peace and goodwill. So I believe that this
unfailing law will cripple and dissolve the
Empire of Wilhelm. Right is might. That
has been our slogan in this great crusade.</p>

<p>Yet we are not a perfect people. The war
has judged us and found us wanting. But the
war can save us&mdash;<i>if we are wise</i>. We must
search our hearts. The dear boys have died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that we might live. How shall we live?
Must we go back to the parish pump? Is
there no avenue of escape from class war and
the devilish tricks of the political machine?
Shall the remnants of our army return to
be tools of the men who never fought; tools
of those who quarrelled for place instead of
nobility; mere puppets, hounded to the
polling-booth to vote for sneaks and rogues?
God forbid! Our slaughtered boys must form
the rampart wall against the selfishness and
the pettiness which mar our otherwise beautiful
country. The old order will <i>not</i> do. The
eyes of ‘The Boys’ have been opened. They
are thinking; and sometimes their thoughts are
bitter. If these thoughts were printed in full
our proconsuls would be staggered. There is
no hope for Britain if soft-handed, soft-job
mandarins retain the reins. Yet ‘The Boys’
are mute, for they have no Press. They
require none. When they return they will
sweep away the fools and build a happy land.
They are not Bolsheviks, not ‘Tories’ or
‘Radicals.’ They are patriots. The patriotism
born in suffering is a product of God.
You cannot define it, and you can never master
it. Do not attempt it. Should you warp,
twist, or bend it for mere material ends, you
will rouse a bitterness and a madness which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
may destroy you, as Trotsky has destroyed
the real soul of a noble nation. Only honest
men can deal with ‘The Boys.’ Brave men
can lead them. Clean men can inspire them.
But these leaders will not be found in great
numbers amongst the old mandarins&mdash;the men
who stayed at home. Ah, no! ‘The Boys’’
standard is bravery. ‘White men’ they know
and understand. The puppets of the party
whips they will blow away like chaff whirled
before a storm. And out of their suffering
will come sanity, peace, goodwill to men and
nations.</p>

<p>This is no dream. Those who scoff misunderstand
the mentality of our men. The
men of Grade I. can dominate Grade II. and
Grade III. The five million fighters are men
of will. A will steeled in the furnace of ‘Hell’
can pierce and master the will created in the
soft lounges of Mayfair or the I.L.P. halls
of Clapham. The veterans of the American
Civil War united, rejuvenated, created the
wonderful America of to-day. Our veterans
can also rebuild the suffering British Empire.
Open out your arms when they come home.
Do not disguise your aims. Speak like
Lincoln or Emerson. Ask for the truth, and
they will deliver it. Kill the fatted calf,
and when the feast is done, place the laurels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of power upon their brows. They will never
deceive you. While they may smash old and
useless traditions, they will guard the Flag,
respect the Monarchy, and develop the finest,
fairest Democracy this world has ever seen.
Far better to have the Democracy of the
trenches than the Anarchy of Trotsky. <i>For
Heaven’s sake, be wise!</i></p>

<p>Such is the mentality of our brave boys.
Fools will fear it, but straight men will rejoice.
The Church can take heart, for the university
of war has quickened spiritual thought. Blind
as many of these men are, they are seeking,
groping for light. Their eyes are scanning
the horizon for the idealism which can heal
their sorrows and lighten the daily load. The
madness of war is causing them to search for
gladness. Old theological tricks will not suffice.
A broad-based creed, aided by the finest
music and social joys, may capture their souls.
Women, too, must figure in the scheme. These
men, many of them broken, desire to slip
into an ivy-clad cottage where sweet Love
shall reign, and the prattle of the child
drown the memories of the shambles. From
their windows they shall gaze in search of the
beauties of the valley, the strength of the hill,
and the soothing ripples of the ever-rumbling
brook. This is the only cure for the horrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of war. Should you give them the pub. and
the music-hall, you will perpetuate the follies
of Bacchus and the creed of the courtesan.</p>

<p>All this I have learned in billets, camps,
and the stricken field. From the stench of
the trenches, the oozing blood of the shambles,
and the agonised features of the dead I have
plucked a moral and a great philosophy. The
vanities have departed. Deceits are unfolded;
Mammon is exposed. While horrors have
unnerved, even unmanned, me, I have found
a new Love&mdash;Love of ‘The Boys.’ It is a
wonderful Love. It thrills and holds. It
rouses and cheers. The soul is filled with
better things. Great visions pass and repass
before my eyes. One feels determined to leave
the world a little better than one found it.
Yea, one becomes resolved to fight, to suffer,
be a martyr, if need be, for the men who have
fought and won. Great is our opportunity,
great our responsibility. We stand at the
cross-roads of morality and materialism. Let
us consecrate our lives for these brave men.</p>

<p>My heart swells with a bursting affection.
My eyes are dimmed as I think of the dead.
I am young, yet I feel old. But my soul
is cleaner, stronger, greater through contact
with&mdash;’The Boys.’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="pch">A JOLLY RAG.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">When</span> all had returned from leave, Dame
Rumour got busy. Some of the lads
had been going it, and their exploits had got
abroad. Even Billy, the padre, was in the
gossip-market, and Ginger was alleged to have
been seen in a two-seater with the famous
beauty from the hotel. As for Tosher, it was
said he had been doing the heavy with the
ladies of Glasgow.</p>

<p>To amuse ourselves, we called a secret
meeting and decided to hold a court-martial,
Nobby being elected president. The following
notice was posted up in the hut:</p>

<p class="pc1"><span class="mid">COURT-MARTIAL.</span><br />

A Court-Martial will assemble in the Hut<br />
on Friday Evening for the Trial of<br />
<span class="smcap">Billy Greens</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Ginger Thomson</span>,<br />
and<br />
<span class="smcap">Tosher Johnson</span>.<br />
All witnesses are warned to attend.</p>

<p class="pr6"><span class="smcap">John Brown</span>, Adjutant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">There was a great rush on the ‘early doors.’
At 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Nobby appeared, dressed up as a
stout colonel, with a moustache like Ole Bill.
He looked most impressive, and roused a cheer.
The members of the court followed. All took
their seats, and Billy Greens was ushered in
by the court-martial orderly.</p>

<p>‘Before proceeding,’ said Nobby, ‘I should
like to know if the accused has any objection,
either to me, as president, or to any member
of the court.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir, I object to you,’ answered Billy.</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘You’re a rotten old Radical and&mdash;a
lawyer.’</p>

<p>‘Your objection is out of order. This is a
military court, and politics do not enter into
the matter. If I am a lawyer, I can assure
you there will be no charges&mdash;I mean, no
six-and-eight.’</p>

<p>‘Question!’ shouted Ginger.</p>

<p>‘Please bludgeon that Imperialist,’ commanded
the president.</p>

<p>Ginger was gagged. The case was proceeded
with.</p>

<p>‘Corporal Billy Greens, No. 1 Company of
the&mdash;th Cadet Battalion, you are charged
with (1) Giddiness on leave; (2) Appearing in
public with a formidable female; (3) Holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
her hand in a tram-car; (4) Acting the goat
in a taxi-cab.’</p>

<p>‘Do you plead guilty or not guilty?’</p>

<p>‘Not guilty.’</p>

<p>‘Evidence, please,’ ordered the president.</p>

<p>Beefy stepped forward with a ponderous-looking
document like the Magna Carta. It
was really one of Harrods’ voluminous catalogues.
Opening it up, he commenced: ‘Sir,
the accused, who is a gentleman in holy orders,
but meantime a soldier, has hitherto borne
an excellent character. But we have received
reports from the Platoon Secret Service men
stating that on his last leave he has been
“going it.” Apparently he went to a small
town near London, and commenced to pay
attention to a lady of blameless character, but
of formidable appearance, and inclined to be
frisky and sentimental when receiving the
attention of man.’</p>

<p>‘Keep to the point, Mr Jones. Please deal
with the first charge,’ remarked the president.</p>

<p>‘I’m just coming to that, sir,’ replied Beefy,
turning over Harrods’ catalogue. ‘The first
charge is “Giddiness.” Our agents state the
accused was wearing a field-marshal’s trousers&mdash;an
offence punishable by death, according to
the Manual of Military Law. He also wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
bright-yellow shoes and white socks, ornamented
with yellow flowers, which I contend
betrays a somewhat frivolous mind. Above
the neck of his tunic appeared a white india-rubber
collar, and sticking out from under his
tunic-sleeves were white cuffs, ornamented with
a balance-sheet of his holiday expenses. He
also carried an enormous Malacca cane studded
with brass knobs, of the type used by lion-tamers
and wealthy Jews. In fact, his whole
appearance was that of the Bank ‘Oliday kind.
Instead of looking like a harmless and shuffling
cadet, he really resembled Ole Bill on the
burst. So startling was his appearance that a
terrier-dog fell off a tram-car, and an ancient
cab-horse jumped into an egg-merchant’s window.
To save further calamity, the local
police had to hide him in a furniture-van and
remove him to his lodgings.</p>

<p>‘The second charge is, “Appearing in public
with a formidable female.” The lady in question
is of uncertain age, but of great stature&mdash;six
feet high, three feet broad, and built in
proportion.’</p>

<p>‘Weight and style, I presume,’ said the
president.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. I also understand she is the
commandant of a V.A.D. Hospital. Prior to
the war she was a suffragette who achieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
fame by burning down the local bishop’s
bathroom.’</p>

<p>‘Has the bishop used Pears’ since that
event?’ inquired a member.</p>

<p>‘No, sir. I understand he uses the wash-house.&mdash;But
to resume. When she appeared
in public with the accused (she being of massive
mould, and he being of bantam measurements),
the contrast was striking. In fact, the difference
in height was so great that it is stated
she carried a small portable telephone to carry
on the conversation. He called her “Gertie,”
and she called him “Pickles.” While attempting
to enter a very narrow gate in the public
park, the lady got wedged, and it is alleged
she shouted, “Push me&mdash;push me, Pickles.”
The accused nobly responded, and relieved the
lady from an embarrassing position.’</p>

<p>‘Was the gate damaged?’ asked the president.</p>

<p>‘Slightly bent, sir.&mdash;Now for the third
charge. The lady, who has been trying to
“get off” for quite a number of years, was
apparently so bucked with her capture that
she aired him on every public occasion. They
were always riding in tram-cars. On one
occasion a local alderman, who has a reputation
for “picking up” unattached females,
entered the car they were travelling in. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
lady, apparently nervous about getting the
glad eye from this civic Lothario, muttered,
“Hold my hand, Pickles&mdash;hold my hand.”
Like a brave man, he did so. In this simple
and trusting manner they completed their
journey, to the amusement of all.</p>

<p>‘The final charge is, “Acting the goat in a
taxi-cab.” Apparently the dear old girl had
been overhearing some of the younger V.A.D.’s,
her colleagues, relating thrilling experiences of
taxi-cabs. She decided to try the experiment,
and Pickles drew a pound note from the Penny
Savings Bank for that purpose. To avoid
observation, they ordered the taxi to meet
them in a quiet thoroughfare. But a local
press photographer witnessed the amusing
struggle of the lady to get inside.</p>

<p>‘“Pickles!” she shouted.</p>

<p>‘“Yes, dear,” he replied.</p>

<p>‘“The door is too small. Push me.”</p>

<p>‘Pickles pushed again, and the lady fell
inside. At that moment the camera clicked.
Here is the photo, sir;’ and Beefy handed
over a charcoal drawing of Billy heaving an
enormous lady into a vehicle.</p>

<p>Loud laughter in court.</p>

<p>‘The taxi-man then received secret instructions
from the accused to drive ten times
round the park&mdash;<span class="smcap">DEAD SLOW</span>. During this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
performance several of the local special
constables saw the lady with the accused in
her arms. At intervals they kissed each
other. When they alighted from the cab, our
Secret Service men discovered a hair-switch
and an upper set of false teeth among the
cushions. This, sir, is, I think, complete
evidence of frivolous conduct.’</p>

<p>‘I see! I see!’ muttered the president,
tugging his false moustache. ‘Now, Mr
Jones, have you any evidence as to how the
accused met this lady? Was he introduced,
or was it what we in the army term a
“pick-up”?’</p>

<p>‘So far as I know, they were properly
introduced. Some years ago, when the accused
was a student, he saw the lady bathing in a
crimson dress with lace-curtain frillings. He
secured an intro. by the aid of a member of a
local Dorcas Society.’</p>

<p>‘What about his character?’</p>

<p>‘Hitherto most respectable; but I imagine
his association with my friends Messrs. Ginger
Thomson and John Brown has, unfortunately,
caused him to fall from grace. That’s all, sir,’
concluded Beefy.</p>

<p>‘What have you got to say, my man?’ said
Nobby, with the air of a Lord Chief-Justice.</p>

<p>‘Nothing, sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing! My dear old Pieface, this is a
serious business. You go on leave; you wear
a field-marshal’s trousers, a padre’s white shirt,
shop-assistant’s yellow shoes, and you carry a
ship-pole for a walking-stick. You cause an
innocent dog to fall off a tram-car, and a
hitherto respectable horse to jump into an
egg-merchant’s window, and yet you say,
“Nothing.” Worse; you try to outdo Charlie
Chaplin in a tram-car, and Ole Bill in a taxi.
This from a future officer, an ordained padre,
and a Tory gentleman will <i>not</i> do. It is
preposterous! You <i>must</i> be shot! <i>Must</i> be
shot!’ roared Nobby with dramatic fervour,
which reminded us of the old com. on the
bench.</p>

<p>‘You’re a silly old ass, Nobby!’ said Billy.</p>

<p>‘That’s contempt of court.’</p>

<p>‘You’re a rotten old Radical!’</p>

<p>‘That means execution.’</p>

<p>‘And here goes your bench,’ shouted Billy,
making a running jump at Nobby’s table, and
kicking it up in the air, sending ink, pens,
paper, books, &amp;c. flying right and left.</p>

<p>‘Remanded! Remanded!’ shouted Nobby,
brandishing a poker.</p>

<p>The prisoner was seized and put in ‘quod,’
or, in other words, let go. His ragging was
over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>


<p>II.</p>

<p>‘The next prisoner,’ demanded the president
when the table had been restored to its feet
and the papers had been tidied up.</p>

<p>Ginger Thomson was marched in, guarded
by an escort, who were armed with wet mops.
We knew Ginger!</p>

<p>‘Sergeant Ginger Thomson, No. 1 Company,
&mdash;th Cadet Battalion, you are charged with
(1) Posing as a woman-hater; (2) Declining
to wash; (3) Joy-riding in a Ford car.’</p>

<p>‘Evidence, please, Mr Brown,’ ordered the
president.</p>

<p>‘Sir, this youth, for the past two months,
has been posing to all as an enemy of the
opposite sex. In a recent discussion he
declared that women were soulless, inconstant,
mercenary, and loved us only when we had
chocolate or plenty of the golden goblins.
We believed him to be sincere, and he received
homage as the great monk of our platoon.
Other remarkable attitudes in controversy
convinced many of us that this brilliant but
erratic gentleman was simply pulling our legs.
By accident we discovered that he is an
ardent admirer of the beautiful lady who
dispenses ale and bitters at the local hotel.
In fact, our agents have procured a grammophone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
record of a conversation with this fair
lady. This is the record,’ I added, turning on
the gramophone, the record of which had been
faked for the occasion.</p>

<p>‘Edison Bell Record.’</p>

<p>Gur-r-r-gurr-r-r-r.</p>

<p>‘Hello, old girl; how are you?’</p>

<p>‘What cheer, Ginger?’</p>

<p>‘Gin and ginger, quick&mdash;awful thirst, old
girl! Bring it up to the private room.’</p>

<p>‘Right-o, dearie!’</p>

<p>Gurr-r-gurr-r-r-gurr.</p>

<p>‘There you are, Ginger&mdash;don’t! The
master’ll hear us. Oh, my hair!... You’ve
broken my comb. You mustn’t kiss me. Oh,
Mr Thomson!... ‘Oo’d a’ thought it?’</p>

<p>Gurr-r-gurr-r-r-gurr.</p>

<p>‘You’re a dear old thing!’</p>

<p>‘And you’re a giddy boy.... You
mustn’t.... If the master sees me sittin’
on your knee, there’ll be trouble.... Ah,
don’t!’</p>

<p>Gurr-r-gurr-r-r.</p>

<p>And the record ended, just in time, for
Ginger let fly and kicked it to the other end
of the room.</p>

<p>‘Tie him up! Tie him up!’ ordered the
president.</p>

<p>It was a tough job, but we managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
get his feet tied, then stood him up before
the ‘beak.’</p>

<p>‘Carry on, Mr Brown,’ commanded Nobby.</p>

<p>‘That record, sir, absolutely proves that
this man deals in terminological inexactitudes.’</p>

<p>‘You mean he is a common or garden
chancer?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. The second charge is equally
serious. He has an objection to soap, and
loathes water like a Bolshevik.’</p>

<p>‘Has he no soap in his possession?’ asked
a member.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, sir, a small piece, which he received
three years ago on enlistment. This is it:</p>

<table id="t14" summary="t14">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdc">GINGER’S SOAP.<br />1915-1918.</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p>‘Note the size. He keeps this for kit
inspections, and I understand he is to make
it a family heirloom after the war.</p>

<p>‘Now for the third charge&mdash;“Joy-riding
in a Ford.” During his leave he was seen
several times in a palatial petrol tin-can,
accompanied by a fair lady. The lady was
holding his hand, and the car was doing a
cake-walk down the road. Several roosters
and pet-poodles are at present in the mortuary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Two maiden ladies demand his life,
and the town council have sent in a bill for
two policemen and three lamp-posts. That’s
all, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Very serious! Very serious!’ muttered
Nobby, chewing his Ole Bill moustache.
‘What about his character?’</p>

<p>‘He lost it at St Omer.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’</p>

<p>‘Found by the A.P.M. (Assistant Provost-Marshal)
singing “Home, Sweet Home,” on
the top of a lamp-post.’</p>

<p>‘Then he is hopeless?’</p>

<p>‘Absolutely, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Ginger, you are a bad lad,’ commented the
president. ‘Have you anything to say?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir,’ shouted Ginger, seizing a mop
out of the escort’s hand and charging full tilt
at the president. He caught Nobby in the
chest and heaved him over in excellent style.
But the valiant president arose and shouted,
‘Duck him! Duck him!’</p>

<p>Ginger was seized and promptly heaved into
the company bathroom. ‘You are a lot of
blighters,’ said he on emerging. However,
Ginger was a sport, and took it merrily.
When he returned to the courtroom he
promptly changed the rôle of prisoner for that
of prosecutor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>‘Next prisoner,’ ordered the president, after
shaking himself and wiping the traces of the
mop off his face.</p>

<p>Tosher Johnson was marched in, guarded
by two hefty lads. We were taking no risks
with the wild Canadian.</p>

<p>‘Corporal Tosher Johnson, No. 1 Company,
&mdash;th Cadet Battalion, you are charged with
(1) Worshipping the almighty dollar; (2)
Always muttering “gaw-damn;” (3) Pulling
a railway alarm-cord; (4) “Swanking it” in
Glasgow.’</p>

<p>‘Evidence,’ commanded the president.</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ said Ginger, ‘the accused is a Canadian,
and therefore a mystery. He blew in
about 1915 from out West, and reckoned he
was <i>the</i> man to win the war. His career is
like that of all backblockers&mdash;most varied and
adventurous. He commenced life eating pork-pies
in Nova Scotia. At the age of twelve he
was assistant to a negro medicine-man, who
sold corn-cure at a penny a time. The corn-cure,
I may say, was made out of wagon-grease
stolen from the C.P.R. Having done
in the son of Ham for about a hundred dollars,
he went West, where he started a shoe-shining
parlour and a horse-betting booth. Next he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was seen in a fat-reducing advertisement; after
which, he floated a company to supply the
ladies of Winnipeg with imitation busts.</p>

<p>‘In these ventures he was, like all Canucks,
highly successful, and therefore plunged into
real estate. This is a get-rich-quick scheme.
Tosher was a star turn. He took double-page
advertisements in the home papers, and sold
corner lots to dukes, commoners, and simpletons.
When these “duds” went out to stake
their plots in Paradise Alley, they discovered
their land was in the Arctic regions, and
tenanted only by Eskimos. What did Tosher
do? Why, he simply apologised, and said his
clerk had made a mistake by <i>turning the map
upside-down</i>!</p>

<p>‘Since then he has had a dollar for his crest,
a dollar for his god. He has got money in
everything from corn-plaster to chewing-gum,
and he reckons to fizzle off this ‘ere planet (as
he calls it) with about a hundred thousand
dollars, earned while chewing cigars and drinking
cocktails in Montreal, Toronto, and the
mixed-bathing cave up in Banff, Alberta. The
fellow’s a marvel!’</p>

<p>‘Look here, Mr Thomson; this is a court-martial.
Evidence! Evidence! We’re not
here to get the story of how we all lost our
money before the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir! The second charge is,
“Always muttering ‘gaw-damn.’” That is the
motto on his shirts and socks. When he spits
it out with a Chicago tang, he means you to
know he’s no soft-headed fellow from Balliol,
but a real son of a gun from Chewing-Gum
Land. This historic adjective is joined to
“guessing” and “calculating.” And he reckons
he’s real prime, six-shooting, hot stuff in this
gaw-damn land of weasels and crows. And
he isn’t slow! He can talk the head off a
Dutchman, pulverise a cockatoo, give you
a one-pound note for a tenner, and send you
away with a feeling that he’s <i>real good</i>, and
the best kid that ever dropped out of
“Taurauntoe.”</p>

<p>‘The third charge, sir, is, “Pulling a railway
alarm-cord” while on leave. Apparently he
got into the company of a simple old Scottish
gentleman, who was accompanied by his wife
and rather charming daughter. Tosher took
the corner seat like a conqueror, and muttered,
“It was real fine to get away from the gaw-damn
Boche.”</p>

<p>‘“Are you just from the Front?” the old
gent inquired.</p>

<p>‘“Yip!” he said, lighting a twopenny havana.</p>

<p>‘“You’re a Canadian, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>‘“Sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>!”</p>

<p>‘“You fellows are winning the war.”</p>

<p>‘“I guess so.”</p>

<p>‘And in this vein he went on. He spun
them yarns as tall as a wireless mast, relating
how he had missed the V.C. by going round
the wrong corner, lost the D.S.O. because the
gaw-damn officer wasn’t there, and was recommended
by Joffre for the Legion of Honour
for holding up a German army corps with a
Woodbine and a six-shooter. These poor, innocent
mortals were bewildered. The accused is
greater than Louis de Rougemont. He then
showed them nicotine-stained fingers, and said
it was blood; his vaccination-mark was a cut
by a shell; and a birth-mark on his chin was
a bit sliced off by a Prussian prince of the
gaw-damn Prussian Guard.</p>

<p>‘The old gent and his party were thrilled.</p>

<p>‘“But, say, old friend, have a cigar to chew,”
remarked Tosher.</p>

<p>‘“Thanks, I will.”</p>

<p>‘Tosher opened his case, but found it was
empty.</p>

<p>‘“Sorry. I guess I’m run out. Where
can I get some?”</p>

<p>‘“Not till Carlisle. We have two hours to
go yet.”</p>

<p>‘“I reckon we pass other bum towns <i>en
route</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>.”</p>

<p>‘“Oh yes.”</p>

<p>‘“Well, I guess I’ll call the guard,” said
Tosher, jumping up to the alarm-cord.</p>

<p>‘“You can’t pull that&mdash;you’ll be fined.”</p>

<p>‘“What? <i>I’m a Canadian!</i>” And he
pulled the cord. The brakes went on with a
bang, and the old guard hurried up along the
line.</p>

<p>‘“Say, old Father Time,” shouted Tosher.</p>

<p>‘“What’s up?”</p>

<p>‘“Stop yer old bus at the next bum town.
I want some cigars to chew.”</p>

<p>‘“I’ll shove ye in jail!” roared the guard.</p>

<p>‘“Easy, old child.”</p>

<p>‘“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>‘“My mother christened me Johnson.”</p>

<p>‘“You’re a Canadian, I suppose?”</p>

<p>‘“Yip!”</p>

<p>‘“All right. I’ll show you I’m a Scotsman.”</p>

<p>‘Tosher didn’t get the cigars. He got
“Five quid, or twenty-one days,” at the Police
Court.’</p>

<p>‘What did he say to that?’ inquired the
president.</p>

<p>‘Oh, he reckoned it was gaw-damn stiff that
a bloke who was winnin’ the war couldn’t get
out of an express for cigars.’</p>

<p>‘I see! I see!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>‘The final charge, sir, is, “‘Swanking it’ in
Glasgow.” He had a maple-leaf in his cap
about the size of a young fir-tree, smoked
evil-smelling cheroots the size of a submarine,
stopped the traffic when he wanted to cross
the road, and tried to elope with all the best-looking
women in the town.</p>

<p>‘“Who are you?” asked an interested lady.</p>

<p>‘“Tosher Johnson, real prime, and the best
kid out of Taurauntoe.”</p>

<p>‘“All right! There’s my card. Call and
see me to-morrow.”</p>

<p>‘When Tosher got there her father was
waiting for him. <i>The old man was a brain
specialist.</i> That’s all the evidence, sir,’ concluded
Ginger.</p>

<p>‘Johnson,’ said the president, ‘your career
and exploits resemble those of the Arabian
Knights and the adventures of Louis de
Rougemont. What have you got to say?’</p>

<p>‘Well, boss, I guess Ginger is the brother of
Ananias, and the uncle of the Kaiser. He’s
just real good at the story-faking business, and
after the war we’ll get him to run the <i>Real
Estate News</i>, and the selling of corner lots
in Greenland and Hudson Bay. As for the
“Canuck” being top-dog in the lead-swinging
business, I reckon that’s fizzled out. If Oxford
can pan out liars like this ‘ere child in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
future, we from out West will have to take a
back-seat in the boosting business. Why, the
fellow ‘u’d make his pile hanging around a
Calgary beer-bar, telling them how to make
a nigger into a white man, and how to turn a
thousand dollar notes into ten million of the
hard stuff.</p>

<p>‘As for “gaw-damn,” “guessing,” and “calculating,”
seems to me you need some new
language to tickle this old country up. You
are a long-faced lot o’ wowsers, tied up by
regulations and B.C. institooshuns. When
you want to meet a prime girl, you need an
intro.; and if you’re keen on eating with a
duke, you’ve got to show your birth-certificate,
and prove your father didn’t bring you into this
world o’ woe without a nine-carat wedding-ring.
It makes me real tired to walk around and see
your orders: “Keep off the Grass;” “Keep
to the Right;” “No Smoking Allowed;”
“Private&mdash;Trespassers will be Prosecuted.”</p>

<p>‘That’s your whole gaw-damn system. You
ain’t a free-thinking crowd; you’re a bunch of
kids kept in order by bamboo canes and laws
made by Moses. Even your little rabbits, that
we gives to our dawgs, are protected by ancient
statoots with about a ton of sealing-wax hanging
on the tail.</p>

<p>‘As for your women, you don’t know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to make them smile. They’re the best-lookin’
kids on the planet, and they’re just real glad
that we wild men are over to tickle them up
and make them dance. Say, boys, but you
are just dead-slow. Why, I can get anything
in petticoats, from an heiress to a barmaid, by
giving them a Taurauntoe glad eye, and saying,
“Come on.” You fellows are the fag-end of
an old system, and if it weren’t for us prime
hustlers from out West, you’d be losing this
fightin’ business.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, old cow-punching Bill, this isn’t
a bally entertainment. It’s a court-martial.
You’re on your trial for your life. What have
you got to say?’</p>

<p>‘We never says anything out West.’</p>

<p>‘What do you do?’</p>

<p>‘Shoots!’ And Tosher banged three rounds
of blank ammunition in the air.</p>

<p>‘Seize him! Seize him! He’s an outlaw
and a desperado!’ roared Nobby.</p>

<p>We rushed Tosher, but he let fly at his
escort, and seized Nobby in his powerful arms
and dumped him out of the window.</p>

<p>Ginger then caught the Canadian’s legs and
threw him.</p>

<p>‘Kamerad! Kamerad!’ shouted Tosher.</p>

<p>‘All right, we’ll let you off, if you stand a
drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘Sure! Come on, boys;’ and off we went
to have another jolly hour at the canteen.</p>

<p>Tosher was a sport, and he kept us laughing
all the night.</p>

<p>There’s nothing like the army&mdash;for jolly
good fun!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="pch">HISTORY AND ESPRIT DE CORPS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">‘It</span> is a good thing, gentlemen, to cull the
best from the past, and never to ignore
it,’ said Captain Cheerall at another lecture.
‘If our fathers frequently blundered through,
they did so heroically. No army is blessed
with such high traditions, such records of
chivalry and glory, as ours; yet, like all other
armies, it has frequently failed. We do not
claim to have been invincible. We have no
desire to get out on the house-tops to boost
our army. But we have a right to know and
be proud of the battle honours on our flags.</p>

<p>‘This, you may think, is a new line of thought
for me, the arch-priest of the present and the
future. Well, my reason for reminding you is
this: You are of the new faith, the new school,
the New Army. Your success has been
wonderful, and in another lecture I have paid
tribute to your genius, courage, and patriotism.
Now I want to remind you, not of past follies,
but of past glories. Military history glows
with our splendour. The small-minded person
is very apt to remind us of our failures in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
America during the American War of Independence,
our awful blunders in the Crimea,
our shameful disorganisation in the early part
of the South African War. Such accusations
are true. But if you study these failures, get
to know <i>why</i> we failed and <i>where</i> we might
have scored, and thus increase your professional
knowledge. Never be afraid to admit
our errors, but take good care <i>never</i> to repeat
them. This is a maxim you must ever bear
in mind. Even in this war&mdash;at Loos, Neuve
Chapelle, Cambrai, and Gaza&mdash;there are instances
where the human machine went wrong,
instances which afford you food for serious
thought and reflection.</p>

<p>‘But what I really want to concentrate on
to-day is the spirit of the British Army&mdash;that
unconquerable soul which lightens a disaster,
sustains us in reverse, and proclaims to all the
world that we Britishers never know when
we are beaten. That, gentlemen, is the most
priceless asset of our army. To understand
this spirit you must look at our history. You
must dip into the annals of India, Egypt,
Africa, the story of the Peninsular War, or of
Waterloo. In these tomes are the deeds of
your fathers. Our army never fights better
than when it struggles for a moral cause.
We conquered Napoleon in the flower of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
strength, and in our hour of national weakness,
because truth, honour, and decency were
on our side.</p>

<p>‘I do not say we have always been crusaders.
There are wars in which we have played an
Imperial game. Yet, after deep reflection, I
am convinced some Power or Powers must be
predominant in this world, and this leads me
to believe that a Power which is based on
liberty, equality, and fraternity is the Power
entitled to impress its own culture on the
world. And we have always been civilising,
always pioneering, always trying to leave the
world a little cleaner, a little better, than we
found it. This work has been supported and
made possible by the splendour of British arms.</p>

<p>‘What you must take from the past is the
spirit of your fathers&mdash;the simple faith, the
sense of duty, the code of honour, and the love
of country which have been shown by the best
of our men in all our wars. And I do believe
no man is cultured or efficient unless he has a
knowledge of history. This gives you the
reason why. It prevents a gross materialism
from entering your soul. It takes self above
the battle, and enables you to realise that
beyond the trials, the sorrows, and the horrors
of war there is a god-like spirit which is clean,
noble, and must, therefore, be triumphant. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
am not sanctifying war, for I loathe it; but I
am deifying the moral force which is behind
us, for example, in this war. There never was
a cleaner crusade.</p>

<p>‘Self-depreciation is characteristic of our
race. We laugh at ourselves, we call our
brothers fools, and pillory our statesmen and
our thinkers. We are so tolerant, and possess
such a sense of humour, that no one gets much
annoyed. This really is evidence of a certain
greatness. It means we are not sensitive, are
without nerves, and are always willing to hear
the latest buffoon. Now, gentlemen, these are
not bad qualities. But unfortunately they are
qualities which the German exploits, with the
result that he has made our name stink in
the nostrils of neutrals. We have been so
indifferent, so careless, that Hun libels have
taken root, and now a Britisher is regarded
by many neutrals as the swashbuckler of the
world. And this vile creed has been imported
even into our own country, perhaps into our
army, especially among later elements who do
not understand why they were conscripted.
It is a dangerous growth, and must eventually
become a poisonous weed. You must root it
out. Regimental history will help you to do so.</p>

<p>‘Whatever regiment you go to, you must
first read its records, learn its battle honours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
get to know its heroes, study all its personal
traditions, and generally imbibe that <i>something</i>
which has made it wonderful. There
you are on sure ground. You can fascinate
your men with its stories of valour. You
can thrill them with its pride. You can
cheer them with its humour. And you can
make them love you by displaying that intense
devotion to all things pertaining to your
regiment. You will not do this in a day.
But you can do it in a few months. And
<i>yours</i> shall be the glory.</p>

<p>‘Some one has said that the path of duty
is where honour lies. Our military histories
will corroborate that. White in Ladysmith,
Gordon in Khartûm, and Townshend in Kut
are good examples of patient courage and
unselfish devotion. The death of Captain
Oates of the Dragoon Guards is a fine story,
if not actually military. This British officer
and gentleman, when stricken with disease,
walked out into the Antarctic snow to die,
rather than burden his companions and bring
them to death and disaster. There are thousands
of anecdotes of this order. When you
read them your spine will thrill at the valour
of your fathers.</p>

<p>‘And I should like you to study very closely
the spirit of friendship between the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
officer and the private soldier. This is a
wonderful story. It shows we have discipline,
and yet we have none. In other words, it
illustrates that we have got things done
because the men liked their officers, and not
because they “had to.” You have to discover
that secret. It is easy to find. Frankness,
courtesy, love, and courage are the basic
elements of the plan. The gentle patience,
the benevolent rule, and the paternal anxiety
of our fathers were wonderful things. They
made the British Tommy the most faithful, the
most willing, the finest soldier in the world.
He has no equal. He will never let you down.
But you cannot get the best out of him unless
you model your personal conduct on the lives
of Kitchener, Roberts, Maude, or Wauchope.
These four men are pictures of simple British
gentlemen, with Christian instincts, a plain
sense of duty, an unalterable devotion to
their country, and a <i>magnificent</i> belief in their
fellow-men.</p>

<p>‘Again, I do want you to feel that a British
officer is no vain person, put up for the admiration
or the subjugation of the mob. Do not
be a sabre-rattler. Let your demeanour to the
civilian crowd be one of chivalry. If we are
democratic in our politics, all of us, even the
private soldiers, are aristocrats in temperament.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
We loathe a bounder; we hate a prig, scorn
a sneak, and curse a knowing fool. Carry
the white flower of a blameless life, and
champion all things which make for the
propagation of truth, civilisation, and honour.
You may even take from the German his
virtues, but you must leave him his vices.
The British officer is watched by millions of
neutrals, and it is important that his high
calling should earn the approbation of their
historians. <i>Better to die for our chivalry than
succumb to the bestial creed and the foul dishonour
of the Huns.</i></p>

<p>‘History, I say, will give you much. It
will prove that there is a wonderful fire and
force in our race. Our island story is very
well summed up by Kipling when he says:</p>

<p class="pph6 p1">What should they know of England<br />
Who only England know?</p>

<p class="p1">‘When you have travelled the Seven Seas;
when you have walked in the footsteps of
frontiersmen, seen the Valhalla of heroes and
the sleeping-place of martyrs, watched tribes
and nations of all creeds and colours saluting
the British officer and the British flag, it is
then you feel:</p>

<p class="pph6">
There is a voice divine,<br />
And a mission that is high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">‘Gentlemen, here is the proof of our liberty
and wisdom. At Gallipoli are the graves of
free Colonists with no ties to this country
except the ties of blood. Their country is
a labour country. Imperialism is banned. It
is sometimes termed a democracy gone mad.
Yet when Germany threw down the gauntlet
these freemen came forth to help the Old
Land. They died like Trojans. They died
for <span class="smcap">LOVE</span>. They died that we might live.
And their brothers to-day are dying in
France. Side by side are those wonderful
Canadians, glorious Newfoundlanders, gallant
South Africans, brave Indians&mdash;indeed, all
nations under the British flag. They have not
rendered lip-service. They have given the
flower of their land that this Old Country,
the mother of Democracy, the breeder of
nations, and fount of tolerance, shall keep her
lamps burning brightly and repel the hordes
who would destroy the Crucifix and deify the
sword. You can understand this devotion
only by a study of the past.</p>

<p>‘When you have mastered military history,
you will quickly grasp the value of <i>esprit de
corps</i>. You will know <i>why</i> the Guards would
scorn to be called Highlanders; <i>why</i> the
Highlanders would shoot you if you put them
into the Guards; <i>why</i> the K.R.R.’s want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
beat the Rifle Brigade, and <i>why</i> the Rifle
Brigade believe they are better than the
K.R.R.’s; <i>why</i> Dragoons think themselves
superior to Hussars, and <i>why</i> Hussars would
sicken if you named them Dragoons; <i>why</i> the
R.H.A. believe that the R.F.A. are not fit to
lick their boots, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Unimportant
as these things may seem to the uninitiated,
they are really the basis of good work and
true fellowship. This spirit is the same as the
spirit of the public schools. You will not find
this spirit in Germany. Force is the gospel of
Germany, even in school and in sport. <i>Force
never made a gentleman or a great nation.</i>
Let me tell you a story. A broad-minded
German was travelling past the playing-fields
of Eton before the war. He saw the boys
playing Rugger, Soccer, &amp;c., and immediately
ordered his car to stop. He sat for quite a
long time looking at the clean, bonny British
boys playing their games. Then he jumped
up, took off his hat, and shouted, “Ah, mine
friends, I would lub to be one Breetish boy!”</p>

<p>‘That is a very great tribute from an enemy.
To you we hand the guardianship of that spirit.
You must believe that to “play up, and play
the game,” is the noblest thing in life. You
must live <i>not</i> for self, but for country. Your
wealth, your gifts, your pleasures, even your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
loved ones, must be surrendered at the call of
duty. Duty is the keystone of patriotism.
And patriotism has made us what we are.
The defects of this system are outweighed by
its virtues. “The word of an Englishman”
is all they ask of a Britisher in the Argentine.
<i>But from a Hun they demand an agreement,
stamped, sealed, dated, and witnessed.</i> What
finer tribute can you have to the spirit of our
race?</p>

<p>‘An army, gentlemen, without a soul is a
vile and cruel instrument. It will commit excesses.
It will rape, plunder, and demoralise.
It will stink in history, like the armies of
Attila, Cortes, and the Kaiser. We must
avoid that. We cannot do so unless you leave
this school with a full knowledge of history, an
appreciation of <i>esprit de corps</i>, a love of the
truth, and an adherence to the principles of
justice. You must all be Maudes and not
Bernhardis; quit ye like men; do harm to
no child, no woman; so conduct yourselves
that when you leave France or Belgium the
populace will line the route, strewing your
path with roses, and shedding tears for the
dead who are gone and the living heroes who
are returning home.</p>

<p>‘It may be, of course, that many of you will
not return, that you may have to suffer torture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
at the hands of your enemy. Let death have
no terrors, for you shall pass to the Valhalla
of heroes. Your name shall be inscribed in
the page of glory, and your memory shall shine
like the sun.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen, words fail me. Emotion is
knocking at my heart. But I feel that I have
shown you the soul of the British Army.
Guard it! Cherish it! Fight for it! And
when this bloody war is over, the world will
take you into its arms, and God will proclaim,
“Well done, thou good and faithful servant.”’</p>

<p>A strange silence fell over the room as the
lecturer finished. The spell had not yet passed.
Men had been transported from the sordid to
the higher things. But when the captain lifted
his stick and gloves to go, we burst into a wild
hurrah.</p>

<p>That night Tosher, whom we dubbed ‘the
Materialist,’ slipped out of the hut about nine-thirty.
He crossed the dark parade-ground,
and made for the officers’ quarters. On
arriving at Captain Cheerall’s domicile, he
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>‘Come in.’</p>

<p>‘Say, cap., I’d like to swot up some of that
history.’</p>

<p>‘I see! What can I do for you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, I guess you’d better lend me a book
to get on with.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly. Here you are. Anything to
oblige a good Canadian.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks, cap. And, I say’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘You were real good on that stunt to-day.
Good-night, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Good-night, Johnson.’</p>

<p>When Tosher got to the hut, he looked at
the book. It was entitled <i>Deeds that Won
the Empire</i>.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE SPIRIT OF GOD.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">The</span> extraordinary thing in our hut was
that the quietest and most decent
member of our little society was, in reality,
the most powerful. This was Billy Greens,
generally known as ‘The Padre.’ In controversy
Ginger or Tosher could simply bowl him
out, but for all that there was a sweetness and
a kindness about him that made him a very
dear pal. He was always so broad, ever
willing to understand us, but quietly and
effectively he was pitting his moral weight
against our immoral and careless code. Billy
had no physical strength to speak of. It was
really a shame to see him in khaki, for temperamentally
he was unfitted for the awful
strain. But he was there of his own choosing.
As he always said, ‘It is a holy war.’ This
gave him a great standing. He was fighting
for a moral cause, and we did think him a cut
above the ordinary parson.</p>

<p>Billy Greens was a ‘white man.’</p>

<p>His strength lay in his private conduct,
which was above suspicion. A fair sportsman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
in a ‘rag’ he took his punishment. We never
heard him speaking about ‘the Cross’ or
‘salvation,’ but in his own charming way he
would lug one or more of us out for a walk,
and land us in the Y.M.C.A., where he
regaled us with refreshments and kept us
to hear the entertainments. And the most
amusing thing was that he and Ginger (the
so-called Rationalist) were the best of pals.
Ginger, however, was no Rationalist; he was
just an argumentative beggar, so brilliant that
he could flatten every one of us out. At all
hours of the day and the night Billy and
Ginger were going it, but it was quite evident
that the padre was coming out top-dog, and
taking the sting out of Ginger’s oratory. As
a matter of fact, after they had lived three
months together, Ginger ceased to batter the
Church, and often helped his clerical chum
to get up concerts for the Y.M.C.A.</p>

<p>The padre was making good.</p>

<p>Even Tosher, the dear old dollar-loving
Canadian, was a champion of the padre. He
was so powerful in the physical sense that he
elected himself as a bodyguard. When there
was a rough-and-tumble on, Tosher always
rescued the gasping curate. There was something
real good in the Canadian. If he was
no great Christian, he was the best-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
man in our platoon, and certainly the bravest
of the crowd. His M.M. and D.C.M. were
evidence of that. And if he did blow his own
trumpet, it was not meant seriously, for Tosher,
like all Canadians, was fond of ‘chewing the
rag.’ The padre made it his business to take
Tosher round all the nice people; indeed,
he got Tosher fixed up with a neighbouring
merchant’s daughter, a most charming girl.</p>

<p>Tosher ceased to violate the moral code.</p>

<p>So far as Beefy and I were concerned, the
padre had a lot of work to do. But he kept
at it in his own quiet way, and although we
never said it, we secretly felt in touch with a
better man, and we always accepted a good
deal of his advice. Billy worked on ‘the
chum principle.’ He simply wormed himself
into our confidence, with the result that we
never cared to offend him. When he called
me ‘John,’ there was something so very
paternal in it that I became submissive, and
a supporter of Billy, if not a perfect ornament
of the Church.</p>

<p>The padre was smashing our lax code.</p>

<p>‘You know, John,’ he said one night, ‘I
shall be sorry to leave here.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘There’s a lot of good work going on.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You fellows are not what you were.
There’s not half the filthy language or the
false bravado there used to be. None of
those disgusting photos are around now. And
nearly all the boys read in the hut at night.
They’re <i>thinking</i>, and that’s all we want them
to do.’</p>

<p>‘What’s done it?’</p>

<p>‘Well, the fresh air, the games, the discipline,
and the general goodwill. The commandant,
of course, is an asset. He’s such a dear old
man that they feel they must be decent.
And unquestionably Captain Cheerall has
been an enormous influence. Just look at all
those fellows swotting up military history,’ he
said, pointing to the crowd with their noses
well down on books.</p>

<p>‘You like army life, then, padre?’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit of it. It has great good in it,
and great dangers. All depends on the men
you live with. Of course, this is an educated
crowd, and they are easy to handle. But I
had an awful time in the ranks. And yet
I wouldn’t have missed this war for worlds.
My eyes are open now. I have seen the good
in men, also the bad. And I hope it will help
me in the future.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think we’ll be the better for this
war&mdash;I mean, in the moral sense?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That’s a big question. I think all the
educated men will reason more, and I believe
they will glorify the home and a good woman.
But for the great crowd I’m not sure.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Well, war loosens things. Women go
wrong, and the marriage vows get broken.
Men in the ranks are like children. One
fool can contaminate a thousand. That’s the
danger. Still, if we can educate them, and if
the parsons will work, we can keep the Old
Land going. And, of course, the Y.M.C.A.
is a powerful force. I tell you, John, if we
had had no Y.M.C.A. in this war, the army
would have been a hotbed of drunkenness and
immorality. Kitchener was the man who saw
this at the beginning. By Jove, that <i>was</i> a
<span class="smcap">MAN</span>!’</p>

<p>‘You’re a Kitchener yourself, Billy.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘It’s you that’s cleaning this hut up.
You’ve been a good pal, and we shall be sorry
to leave you.’</p>

<p>‘Not I, John! Not I!’</p>

<p>‘Who, then?’</p>

<p>‘The Spirit of God. Good-night, old boy.’</p>

<p>As he walked away a lump came into my
throat. I’m a sentimental ass, I know, but
still <i>that’s</i> the sort of padre for <span class="smcap">AFTER THE WAR</span>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">WE DISCUSS THE SCHOOL.</p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">‘Well</span>, boys, in another week we shall
have one pip on our sleeves, and be
wearing Sam Brownes. Heigh-ho, my lads,
for a jolly time! No more guards, no more
fatigues, no more school,’ said Beefy one night.</p>

<p>‘Beefy!’ shouted Ginger.</p>

<p>‘What?’</p>

<p>‘You’re a silly ass. The commission, a bottle
of “fizz,” and a chorus-girl form your entire
outlook. Haven’t you learnt anything here?’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, a little. I’m quite grateful, and
I’ll do my best. I’m not a marvellous fellow
with my headpiece&mdash;and know it&mdash;but I’ll try
to do my job. You’re a wet blanket, Ginger.
Because a fellow laughs and fools about, you
think he hasn’t got guts. Have sense, you
silly old book-guzzler.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll make a good bombing officer, Beefy.
A strong arm and a soft head are all you
require for the Suicide Club,’ remarked Nobby.</p>

<p>‘And you’ll be in the A.S.C., bringing up
the bully-beef. A soft job for a Radical. I
know your crowd. You curse the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
schools, but you push us into the infantry.
Nobby, you are a ruddy fraud.’</p>

<p>‘Let’s sum up the school, boys,’ I said.</p>

<p>‘Right! Lead off,’ commanded Ginger.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t really a bad show. The first time
I saw it, it looked a penitentiary; and when I
spotted all you toughs dropping in, it promised
to be a Hades. But it’s panned out fairly
well. There’s a great lack of intellectual meat&mdash;a
few of the instructors ought to go back
to school&mdash;but still, we’re cleaner, we’re
smarter, we know a few things, and we’ll
make at least half-decent subs. And I think
we ought to be very thankful, considering that
the fellows who received commissions at the
beginning of the war got no training at all,
but had to go straight to the trenches and
find things out. And we have been lucky to
have such a good old sport for a “com.,” as
well as that priceless chap, Cheerall. He’s
the backbone of the school. There has also
been a moral improvement. Ginger has had
a wash, Beefy doesn’t go out after cooks,
Nobby has ceased to pray for Asquith, and
Tosher has suddenly become respectable. I
think we ought to leave with no grouse, and
it’s up to us to give thanks to the commandant
and his staff. They’ve treated us
well, and done their best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>.’</p>

<p>‘I second the motion,’ said Nobby. ‘The
school is a useful institution, and on the whole
has done good work. They have certainly paid
attention to our bodies. We are all healthier,
heavier, hardier, and therefore more fit for
our job. The great defect is, as John Brown
says, a lack of brain-power. But there is
this idea in the military system: “A man
of action cannot be an intellectual.” And
all these old fellows argue, “If they want us
to be butchers, they cannot expect us to be
professors.” To me this is simply an excuse
for mental sloth, and adherence to pre-war
pleasure-loving ways. War is a science and
a conflict of ideas. The army which is most
scientific and has the greatest number of
ideas is bound to win. This country of ours
is packed with ideas; but we are so conservative,
so cursed with classical ways, that
it is a crime for a hustler to start pushing
his ideas to the front. We’re tied up to
seniority, “form,” and rotten old traditions,
which simply choke good fellows off. Reverses
have improved us, and disasters have helped
things on. But why wait for disaster? Why
not let every mother’s son contribute some
ideas to the war-machine, and so help to end
the war?</p>

<p>‘The soul is certainly sound, as Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Cheerall says; but what’s the good of a
soul if you haven’t got push-and-go? Certainly,
we have improved since 1914, and
we are going to win this war all right. Still,
I am not so sure that youth is having its
chance. There are too many old fellows
knocking about. What I want to see is all
those young G.S.O.’s getting the jobs, and
then we’ll have a good time. Look at
Cheerall! He’s an absolute treat! There
are hundreds of men like him in the Old
Army and the New Army. We fellows,
who are new to the business, don’t give a
tinker’s damn whether an instructor or a
staff-officer is a Cecil or a Henderson. We
want the goods. We’re willing to learn.
We’d pawn our boots to go and hear men
like Allenby, Robertson, and Wilson; but
we’ve got a contempt for all those old
blighters who sneer at us, who think we’re
not gentlemen, and regard us simply as
cannon-fodder. The army isn’t democratic
enough. It’s a close preserve, and we
Liberals are going to shake it up. All the
same, I don’t dislike this school. As John
says, the commandant is a dear old father
and a gentleman. If it weren’t for men like
him, we’d all get fed up. As for the sergeant-major,
he’s a terror, but he <i>does</i> know his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
job, and he has taught us a lot. These men
are all right. It’s the system that’s all
wrong. Yet I’m sorry to go, for I have
had a good time with you fellows here. One
thing the army does teach, and that is
friendship. I wouldn’t have been out of this
job for a fortune, and when we part I’ll be
a sorry man.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear!’ roared Beefy.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen,’ said Ginger, rising, ‘you’ve
just heard my honourable friend, the member
for the Manchester School, heave things off
his chest. Having done so, he’s perfectly
happy, for the great secret of keeping such
a person in order is to let him talk&mdash;talk
hard and talk long. He’s a most terrible
Radical, and should he be the Secretary for
War in the next Government, it will be
necessary for me to remove him with a BOMB.’</p>

<p>‘Keep to the point,’ said Nobby.</p>

<p>‘Very well, the point is the school. Much
of what Nobby has said is true. Now and
again we’ve been terribly bored with the
“padding” some of these fellows stuff into
their lectures. The majority are afraid to be
original. Still, on reflection, I think it fair
to say that many never expected they would
have to be schoolmasters. Again, nearly all of
them were brought up under the old system,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
when thinking was very bad form. Still, they
have worked hard. They have treated us
well. The defects which exist are due to the
system, and not to the men. Unfortunately a
few imagine we are Tommies who have never
been to school. They import into their lectures
a lot of stuff which is pure bluff and part nonsense.
We have seen the defects of the General
Staff, and we are prepared to realise all their
difficulties, as well as to note their triumphs.
But it is sheer nonsense to paint them as
supermen. That is a good enough stunt when
talking to a platoon who cannot reason things
out, and who, if told of little things, would
expand them into big things and commence
to grouse. But if we are going to be officers,
then we want to know all the wrinkles. As
Cheerall insists, study <i>where</i> we failed, <i>why</i>
we failed, and <i>how</i> we might have avoided
failure. It’s no good cloaking things. We
were at Loos. We were at Cambrai. But it
is frequently forgotten that we can see things,
for many of us are educated. We’re not here
for fun; we’re here for business.</p>

<p>‘What is always forgotten by military mandarins
is that the nation is in arms. Again
we are fighting for our very lives. But I
<i>don’t</i> think we can apply Nobby’s sweeping
reforms in the middle of a war. Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Russia! There they abolished the salute.
What happened? The army became a mob,
and Russia was sold to Germany. The defection
of Russia is the condemnation of
Democracy&mdash;at least, of Lenin’s Democracy.
And I, for one, am up against all Bolsheviks.
Nobby, of course, doesn’t mean all this. Still,
it takes an Oxford man to balance his impetuous
moods and keep the ship right.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t swing the lead, Ginger,’ cried
Nobby.</p>

<p>‘I am not swinging it, old chap. Your
political strategy is one-sided, and sometimes
lacks vision. Frequently you throw out constructive
ideas, but you want to achieve them
by destructive methods. You can’t do that;
or, at least, if you do there will be chaos.
You keep shouting for Democracy, but you’ve
had it for three hundred years. You really
want the moon. I’m with you, heart and
soul, when you talk about brains, but I’m up
against your method of reform. Go slow, old
man. Work your reforms one by one, without
creating panic and disorder. There are tremendous
forces at work to-day. Unreason
and anarchy are rampant. Give the mob its
head and this old Empire will tumble like a
pack of cards. You condemn Oxford, you
curse the classics, you tilt at the historical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
true political instinct, and you fail to note that
the old system made us what we are&mdash;the
greatest Empire, the greatest people, one of
the most democratic on the earth.’</p>

<p>‘Question,’ said Tosher.</p>

<p>‘It <i>is</i> a question,’ retorted Ginger, swinging
round towards his interrupter, ‘but it’s a
question concerning your educational defects.
You are not taught these things in Canadian
schools. It’s not your fault; it’s your Government’s.
But there’s no excuse for Nobby.
He accepts the whole “Democratic” scheme
with all its blunders. You can carry out his
ideas in a parish council, but you can’t do it
with an army. And while I have endorsed a
good deal of his plea for intellect, I am not
blind to what we have accomplished. He’s
a lawyer, but he’s not judicial, for he has
not given the other side of the case. We
started with an army of one hundred and
seventy thousand strong. We now have an
army of five millions. We have increased the
corps of officers from ten thousand to one hundred
thousand. When we started at Mons we
had only shrapnel, and that was short. Now
we have the finest Ministry of Munitions in
the world. We have shipped an army of
millions over the seas, and lost only two thousand
men by drowning. Thanks to the navy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of course. There were no such schools of
instruction in 1914; now there are hundreds.
It’s all very wonderful. It has been done
slowly, quietly, effectively. True, there have
been horrible blunders, and we have had
reverses. So has the enemy. But in all
man&oelig;uvre battles we have beaten the Germans.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear, Ginger!’ some of us shouted.</p>

<p>‘Now you see where Nobby is wrong. He
concentrates on the failures and forgets the
triumphs. And that is the greatest defect of
his Radical friends. For all that, I’m not
going to say we’re perfect&mdash;no army is perfect&mdash;but
I do say we, as a nation, have done our
best. Certainly, there are much-needed reforms.
I’m with Nobby on the subject of
brains, but I’m not going to back up his
horrible methods of smashing down to build
up. You can’t do that in war-time! Graft
the new on to the old, <i>and we’ll win</i>.</p>

<p>‘As for the school, it has been a priceless
boon for fellowship. I’ve really learnt to love
old Nobby, and tried to understand him. And
Tosher, the man-eating, constitution-smashing
Canadian&mdash;well, we’ve just taken him into our
arms! Like all Colonials, he’s a good fellow.
Then there’s Beefy&mdash;dear old Beefy&mdash;the
king of the ballet, the god of the bar, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the toughest devil who ever came out of
Cambridge. He’s real good! John Brown, of
course, is a dreamer. He revels in romance,
girls, and philosophy. You’ll find him in a
barrage writing to Adela and moralising about
the smell. Finally, there’s dear old Pieface,
the best fellow who ever wore a holy collar.</p>

<p>‘Now, to be serious, boys. I like the school;
but I like you more. We’ve learnt a lot about
war; but we’ve learnt more about each other.
We may not live; but if we do, then “The
Dauntless Six” will meet at Ciro’s, fill a
bumper, and drink long and deep to the
happiest school-days of our lives.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear, Ginger!’ we shouted as he sat
down.</p>

<p>‘I guess I’ve got to get into this business
with my feet,’ said Tosher.</p>

<p>‘Try your head,’ mumbled Ginger.</p>

<p>‘It’s right there, old child, every time,’
answered Tosher, touching his forehead. ‘We
ain’t no one-eyed chicks from Alabama; we
get our wisdom-teeth in a hard country, where
the snow buries you for six months, and the
sun bakes you in the summer. Why, it just
makes me sad to see the Balliol joint pumping
out, “Go slow,” “Steady up,” and
calling old Nobby a Bolshevik. Nobby is the
only spring chicken in the crowd&mdash;but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
don’t understand him. He wants to sweep up
all your old institooshuns, and give you all a
real good time.’</p>

<p>‘Keep to the point, Buffalo Bill,’ said
Beefy.</p>

<p>‘I’m sitting on it, and it’s real hard. Now
I’m going to skin your eyes. I likes this
institooshun. It’s durned slow, and there
ain’t enough ginger in the Old Man. Yet I
reckon I’ve got wise here. They’ve knocked
all the Tommy’s grouse out of me, and given
me hope of a better land&mdash;a commission, a
servant, and a waiter to bring me cocktails
and fat havanas. They’ve shown me how to
eat an omelet, and warned me off drinking
out of a finger-bowl; taught me how to
sign myself “Your obedient servant” when I
don’t feel like it; and to say “sir” to all the
chicks that’ll want a job from me after the
war. They took me in, a tow-headed gum-chewer,
and they reckon they’re turning me
out real prime, first-class, lead-’em-to-Hell
stuff. As one of those old professors said,
“He was a Canadian when he came; now he’s
a gentleman.”</p>

<p>‘Well, boys, I’m real grateful for it all,
though I haven’t much time for etiquette, and
ain’t no use at the “How d’ye do?” business.
Out West we introduce with revolvers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
get our photo taken when there’s a hundred
dollars on our head.</p>

<p>‘We ain’t here for amusement; we’re here
to fight. You can’t do that with kid gloves.
It’s red fighting that will kill the Hun&mdash;not
talking. And, as Nobby says, we need more
brains. That’s a plain proposition, and I’m
his man. However, we haven’t been skinned
in this saloon bar. The Old Man is a white
man. He has been real good to me and you.
Our time’s been a happy time. I’ve learned
to love the Old Country. We Canadians may
be tough, we may even seem white-fanged
gunmen, but, I tell you, we’re in with you
to the end.</p>

<p>‘God help the Huns when I go back!’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear, old Tosher! You’re the goods,’
shouted Billy, rising to wind up our informal
discussion.</p>

<p>‘And now, boys, a last word. Tosher has
shown you the real soul of Canada, the spirit
which brings the Canadians over, and in which
they die. To us all it is a great revelation. He
has been a good pal, just as you all have been,
and our time here has been one of joy. Never
mind this eternal discussion about brains.
Leave that to the powers that be. Look at
ourselves. Are we better men? Are we
better soldiers? Are we really fit to lead our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
own clean boys? That to me is the real issue.
Somehow, I think we’ll do fairly well. We
are all agreed about fighting the German.
We are determined to do so. In this school
they have improved us, and made us more fit
for the task. We have had a dear old gentleman
for a father; our instructors have all
been kind; every one of the staff has done his
duty. It is up to us to show our appreciation,
and, when we leave here, to serve our God, to
honour the King, and die if need be, like true
British soldiers.’</p>

<p>We got up silently, and went to bed.</p>

<p>The thought of parting had gripped the
soul!</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE COMMANDANT’S FAREWELL.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smdrop">There</span> was no mock hilarity on the final
morning. We had too much to do.
Kits had to be packed, books returned, the
hut scrubbed out, and everything left shining
and in order, for the pride of an army is
‘handing over’ in a spotless condition. That
is always a good test of a well-trained and
disciplined unit. Hitherto we had not been
bothered about falderals; we were learning
and swotting, and the commandant had little
use for eye-wash. But this day we knew he
expected to see tables&mdash;nay, floors&mdash;off which
a king might eat his food. The ‘Old Man’
was not disappointed, for we all desired to
leave the school with his fatherly benediction.</p>

<p>The boys were a bit sad. Tosher, Beefy,
Nobby, Ginger, Billy, and myself&mdash;thanks to
the good offices of Captain Cheerall&mdash;were to
be gazetted to the same battalion. This was
a piece of luck. But there were other good
friends who were being scattered to the four
ends of the earth. Many were bound to be
killed; others we might never come across
again. They were our brothers-in-arms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
we loved them as only men can love. The
war and the army had opened our hearts.
We men of all classes, all professions, have
been linked into a loving community, which
only death can sever.</p>

<p>‘Stand to your beds!’ roared the sergeant-major.
We sprang to attention, and the
colonel entered. His keen eye saw everything
spotless and shining. He smiled and
muttered, ‘Splendid, men!&mdash;splendid!’ and
went off round the other huts. When this
was over we were marched to the lecture-room
to hear the ‘com.’s’ farewell.</p>

<p>‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘this will be a happy
day for you. You are going forward. The
King’s commission will shortly be yours.
You will join battalions already famous. The
good name of those regiments and the honour
of our country will then be in your keeping.
We have done our best for you, and I feel you
will not let this school down. We have had
our hard times, our sad times, also our jolly
times, together. No doubt you were often
bored, and did your share of grousing. That
is only human. If you cannot see a marked
improvement in yourselves, I can see it in you.
You were more or less rebellious when you
arrived. You all had different ideas of
discipline, training, tradition, and <i>esprit de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
corps</i>. Many of these ideas were sound;
others were not at all practical. But by
steady grinding, patient teaching, and persistent
application, my staff have created at
least a seed-bed in good soil, and it is for you
to develop the fruits of our instruction. We
have not aimed at making you generals. Our
job was to make you subalterns. There are
other schools to teach you the arts of the
higher command. Perhaps this elementary
curriculum was too slow for the more brilliant;
but these bright ornaments must remember
that in a school like this we have to adapt
our arrangements to the intellect of the
majority, and not of the minority. The
brainy minority can take care of themselves.
It is for us to help the less fortunate, and
give them confidence and the hall-mark of
efficiency. I have a reason for making this
remark, for I know we have intellectuals here,
and I should regret if they left feeling we have
not given them enough.</p>

<p>‘You must also remember that your training
has been crammed into four months instead
of three years, as we used to put in at Sandhurst.
We are at war, and we cannot go into
the bowels of everything. Still, considering
all our disabilities, such as the absence of
many brilliant men at the Front, I do feel we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
have reason to think that, on the whole, the
course has been successful.’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear, sir!’ we shouted.</p>

<p>‘I said, at the beginning, you will no doubt
feel glad at going forward. I also am glad;
but I am sorry too. This has been the most
interesting of all my “courses,” and there are
faces I shall miss, even that of my good
Canadian friend, who, I understand, rejoices
in the remarkable sobriquet of “Tosher.”’
(Loud laughter.) ‘I can assure you, gentlemen,
I have learnt a lot from you. Here we
have a pleasant mixing of the classes and the
masses; also a sprinkling of splendid fellows
from overseas. This confirms my view that
ours is a Democratic army, also an Imperial
army. I rejoice! This is a splendid signpost
to the future. When the job is done, we shall
settle down more friendlily, without the class
distinctions and the horrible class war that
were the curse of this country prior to 1914.
You will also be interested to hear that, if
you men are going forward, I too am about
to receive promotion. I am taking unto
myself a charming lady’&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We cheered tremendously. (By the way,
the lady in question was none other than my
aunt Jane!)</p>

<p>‘Yes&mdash;and next week I leave the school and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the army&mdash;for ever. I am old now. My day
is done. I came back again only to help the
Old Land in its hour of pain and woe. Yet I
think I have the wisdom of my race. This is
a young man’s war. It is not for me to keep
youth and vigour back; to stand a bulwark
against progress, and put back the clock, so
that I, a soldier of the past, may continue to
enjoy the fruits of command. No! That is
folly! We must win this war. Age cannot do
it! It is beyond us! To youth we must hand
the sword and the laurels! And yet, when I
take off my Sam Browne belt and shove on
my tweeds, I shall feel like a captain without a
ship, like a man without a cause. However,
there’s my lady. She will help me through!’</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear, sir!’</p>

<p>‘Another intimation. My successor is
Captain Cheerall. This officer is of the Old
Army, yet of the New. To me he has been
a loyal colleague, a zealous friend, and an
invaluable assistant. He is an extraordinary
compound of intellect and emotion. Every
time he talks to me, I feel I must clap him
on the back. The school is, therefore, in good
hands. When I have gone, perhaps the
intellectuals will not feel so bored.’</p>

<p>‘You never bore us, sir,’ shouted Ginger,
and all of us gave a cheer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Thank you, gentlemen. Your kindness
will lighten my coming darkness. But it’s
of you I must speak. Do not think me a
great Christian, for I am not. But this war,
somehow or other, has brought me face to
face with the fact: <span class="smcap">IT IS A HOLY WAR.</span>
We are not out for <span class="smcap">LOOT</span>. We are out
for <span class="smcap">PRINCIPLES</span>. It is our testing-time. <span class="smcap">God</span>
and <span class="smcap">THE BRUTE</span> are struggling for mastery.
The religion, the morality, the safety of
nations, mothers, and babes are in your
keeping. Should we lose, the Cross will
lose. I do beseech you to think it out, to
lead clean lives, to go forward with the
heart and aim of crusaders. It is not a
burden! It is a privilege! There is no
question of false glory. It is <span class="smcap">DUTY</span>! And
<span class="smcap">DUTY</span> is the hall-mark of honour. Would to
God that I were as young as you, so that I
might fight the good fight and lead you on!
Again, you have all got mothers, sisters,
sweethearts; some of you have wives, perhaps
bonny little babes. It is for you to guard
them. The dripping sword must not be seen
by their eyes, nor their blood stain your
hearths. Think of Belgium! Think of
Serbia! Think of Rumania!</p>

<p>‘Do not waste your time hating! Your
work is <span class="smcap">KILLING</span>. War is Germany’s religion!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Brutality is her philosophy! Domination is
ever her aim and vaunted creed! <i>You must
destroy the loathsome gods of Germany.</i></p>

<p>‘Well, gentlemen, I think that is all. I
shall watch your careers. I shall keep your
records in my study. Each great deed will
be noted in my little book. The higher you
go, the more I shall be pleased. And never
think of me as your commandant. Think of
me as your friend, as a father&mdash;for to me
you’re boys, just dear boys, and I love you
because you are going forth to help this dear
Old Land.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ he said with emotion, and
turned away.</p>

<p>Tosher Johnson led a terrific cheer, and
cried, ‘Let’s carry the Old Man round.’ We
rushed him, lifted him high on our shoulders,
and carried him across to the officers’ mess,
singing:</p>

<p class="ppn6 p1">‘For he’s a jolly good fellow,<br />
For he’s a jolly good fellow,<br />
For he’s a jolly good fellow,</p>
<p class="ppn10">Which no cadet denies.</p>

<p class="p1">‘Hip&mdash;hip&mdash;hooray! Hip&mdash;hip&mdash;hooray!
Hip&mdash;hip&mdash;hooray!’</p>

<p>Thus the New Army parted from the Old.</p>
